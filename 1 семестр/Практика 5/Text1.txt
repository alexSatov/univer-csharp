    1. BOY WHO LIVED
   

   Mr. and Mrs. Dursley, number four, Privet Drive, were proud say that they were perfectly normal, thank you very much. They were last people you'd expect be involved anything strange or mysterious, because they just didn't hold such nonsense.
   Mr. Dursley was director firm called Grunnings, which made drills. He was big, beefy man hardly any neck, although he did have very large mustache. Mrs. Dursley was thin and blonde and had nearly twice usual amount neck, which came very useful she spent so much her time craning over garden fences, spying neighbors. Dursleys had small son called Dudley and their opinion there was no finer boy anywhere.
   Dursleys had everything they wanted, but they also had secret, and their greatest fear was that somebody would discover it. They didn't think they could bear it if anyone found out Potters. Mrs. Potter was Mrs. Dursley's sister, but they hadn't met several years; fact, Mrs. Dursley pretended she didn't have sister, because her sister and her good nothing husband were unDursleyish it was possible be. Dursleys shuddered think what neighbors would say if Potters arrived street. Dursleys knew that Potters had small son, too, but they had never even seen him. This boy was another good reason keeping Potters away; they didn't want Dudley mixing child like that.
   When Mr. and Mrs. Dursley woke up dull, gray Tuesday our story starts, there was nothing cloudy sky outside suggest that strange and mysterious things would soon be happening all over country. Mr. Dursley hummed he picked out his most boring tie work, and Mrs. Dursley gossiped away happily she wrestled screaming Dudley his high chair.
   None them noticed large, tawny owl flutter past window.
   half past eight, Mr. Dursley picked up his briefcase, pecked Mrs. Dursley cheek, and tried kiss Dudley good bye but missed, because Dudley was now having tantrum and throwing his cereal walls.
   “Little tyke,” chortled Mr. Dursley he left house. He got his car and backed out number four's drive.
   It was corner street that he noticed first sign something peculiar—a cat reading map. second, Mr. Dursley didn't realize what he had seen—then he jerked his head around look again. There was tabby cat standing corner Privet Drive, but there wasn't map sight. What could he have been thinking of? It must have been trick light. Mr. Dursley blinked and stared cat. It stared back. Mr. Dursley drove around corner and up road, he watched cat his mirror. It was now reading sign that said Privet Drive—no, looking sign; cats couldn't read maps or signs. Mr. Dursley gave himself little shake and put cat out his mind. he drove toward town he thought nothing except large order drills he was hoping get that day.
   But edge town, drills were driven out his mind by something else. he sat usual morning traffic jam, he couldn't help noticing that there seemed be lot strangely dressed people about. People cloaks. Mr. Dursley couldn't bear people who dressed funny clothes—the getups you saw young people! He supposed this was some stupid new fashion. He drummed his fingers steering wheel and his eyes fell huddle these weirdos standing quite close by. They were whispering excitedly together. Mr. Dursley was enraged see that couple them weren't young all; why, that man had be older than he was, and wearing an emerald green cloak! nerve him! But then it struck Mr. Dursley that this was probably some silly stunt—these people were obviously collecting something… yes, that would be it. traffic moved and few minutes later, Mr. Dursley arrived Grunnings parking lot, his mind back drills.
   Mr. Dursley always sat his back window his office ninth floor. If he hadn't, he might have found it harder concentrate drills that morning. He didn't see owls swooping past broad daylight, though people down street did; they pointed and gazed open-mouthed owl after owl sped overhead. Most them had never seen an owl even nighttime. Mr. Dursley, however, had perfectly normal, owl free morning. He yelled five different people. He made several important telephone calls and shouted bit more. He was very good mood until lunchtime, when he thought he'd stretch his legs and walk across road buy himself bun bakery.
   He'd forgotten all people cloaks until he passed group them next baker's. He eyed them angrily he passed. He didn't know why, but they made him uneasy. This bunch were whispering excitedly, too, and he couldn't see single collecting tin. It was his way back past them, clutching large doughnut bag, that he caught few words what they were saying.
   “The Potters, that's right, that's what I heard—”
   “—yes, their son, Harry—”
   Mr. Dursley stopped dead. Fear flooded him. He looked back whisperers if he wanted say something them, but thought better it.
   He dashed back across road, hurried up his office, snapped his secretary not disturb him, seized his telephone, and had almost finished dialing his home number when he changed his mind. He put receiver back down and stroked his mustache, thinking… no, he was being stupid. Potter wasn't such an unusual name. He was sure there were lots people called Potter who had son called Harry. Come think it, he wasn't even sure his nephew was called Harry. He'd never even seen boy. It might have been Harvey. Or Harold. There was no point worrying Mrs. Dursley; she always got so upset any mention her sister. He didn't blame her—if he'd had sister like that… but all same, those people cloaks…
   He found it lot harder concentrate drills that afternoon and when he left building five o'clock, he was still so worried that he walked straight someone just outside door.
   “Sorry,” he grunted, tiny old man stumbled and almost fell. It was few seconds before Mr. Dursley realized that man was wearing violet cloak. He didn't seem all upset being almost knocked ground. contrary, his face split wide smile and he said squeaky voice that made passersby stare, “Don't be sorry, my dear sir, nothing could upset me today! Rejoice, You-Know-Who has gone last! Even Muggles like yourself should be celebrating, this happy, happy day!”
   And old man hugged Mr. Dursley around middle and walked off.
   Mr. Dursley stood rooted spot. He had been hugged by complete stranger. He also thought he had been called Muggle, whatever that was. He was rattled. He hurried his car and set off home, hoping he was imagining things, which he had never hoped before, because he didn't approve imagination.
   he pulled driveway number four, first thing he saw—and it didn't improve his mood—was tabby cat he'd spotted that morning. It was now sitting his garden wall. He was sure it was same one; it had same markings around its eyes.
   “Shoo!” said Mr. Dursley loudly.
   cat didn't move. It just gave him stern look. Was this normal cat behavior? Mr. Dursley wondered. Trying pull himself together, he let himself house. He was still determined not mention anything his wife.
   Mrs. Dursley had had nice, normal day. She told him over dinner all Mrs. Next Door's problems her daughter and how Dudley had learned new word (“Won't!”). Mr. Dursley tried act normally. When Dudley had been put bed, he went living room time catch last report evening news:
   “And finally, bird watchers everywhere have reported that nation's owls have been behaving very unusually today. Although owls normally hunt night and are hardly ever seen daylight, there have been hundreds sightings these birds flying every direction since sunrise. Experts are unable explain why owls have suddenly changed their sleeping pattern.” newscaster allowed himself grin. “Most mysterious. And now, over Jim McGuffin weather. Going be any more showers owls tonight, Jim?”
   “Well, Ted,” said weatherman, “I don't know that, but it's not only owls that have been acting oddly today. Viewers far apart Kent, Yorkshire, and Dundee have been phoning tell me that instead rain I promised yesterday, they've had downpour shooting stars! Perhaps people have been celebrating Bonfire Night early—it's not until next week, folks! But I can promise wet night tonight.”
   Mr. Dursley sat frozen his armchair. Shooting stars all over Britain? Owls flying by daylight? Mysterious people cloaks all over place? And whisper, whisper Potters…
   Mrs. Dursley came living room carrying two cups tea. It was no good. He'd have say something her. He cleared his throat nervously. “Er—Petunia, dear—you haven't heard your sister lately, have you?”
   he had expected, Mrs. Dursley looked shocked and angry. After all, they normally pretended she didn't have sister.
   “No,” she said sharply. “Why?”
   “Funny stuff news,” Mr. Dursley mumbled. “Owls… shooting stars… and there were lot funny looking people town today…”
   “So?” snapped Mrs. Dursley.
   “Well, I just thought… maybe… it was something do with… you know… her crowd.”
   Mrs. Dursley sipped her tea through pursed lips. Mr. Dursley wondered whether he dared tell her he'd heard name “Potter.” He decided he didn't dare. Instead he said, casually he could, “Their son—he'd be Dudley's age now, wouldn't he?”
   “I suppose so,” said Mrs. Dursley stiffly.
   “What's his name again? Howard, isn't it?”
   “Harry. Nasty, common name, if you ask me.”
   “Oh, yes,” said Mr. Dursley, his heart sinking horribly. “Yes, I quite agree.”
   He didn't say another word subject they went upstairs bed. While Mrs. Dursley was bathroom, Mr. Dursley crept bedroom window and peered down front garden. cat was still there. It was staring down Privet Drive though it were waiting something.
   Was he imagining things? Could all this have anything do Potters? If it did… if it got out that they were related pair of—well, he didn't think he could bear it.
   Dursleys got bed. Mrs. Dursley fell asleep quickly but Mr. Dursley lay awake, turning it all over his mind. His last, comforting thought before he fell asleep was that even if Potters were involved, there was no reason them come near him and Mrs. Dursley. Potters knew very well what he and Petunia thought them and their kind… He couldn't see how he and Petunia could get mixed up anything that might be going on—he yawned and turned over—it couldn't affect them…
   How very wrong he was.
   Mr. Dursley might have been drifting an uneasy sleep, but cat wall outside was showing no sign sleepiness. It was sitting still statue, its eyes fixed unblinkingly far corner Privet Drive. It didn't so much quiver when car door slammed next street, nor when two owls swooped overhead. fact, it was nearly midnight before cat moved all.
   man appeared corner cat had been watching, appeared so suddenly and silently you'd have thought he'd just popped out ground. cat's tail twitched and its eyes narrowed.
   Nothing like this man had ever been seen Privet Drive. He was tall, thin, and very old, judging by silver his hair and beard, which were both long enough tuck his belt. He was wearing long robes, purple cloak that swept ground, and high heeled, buckled boots. His blue eyes were light, bright, and sparkling behind half moon spectacles and his nose was very long and crooked, though it had been broken least twice. This man's name was Albus Dumbledore.
   Albus Dumbledore didn't seem realize that he had just arrived street where everything his name his boots was unwelcome. He was busy rummaging his cloak, looking something. But he did seem realize he was being watched, because he looked up suddenly cat, which was still staring him other end street. some reason, sight cat seemed amuse him. He chuckled and muttered, “I should have known.”
   He found what he was looking his inside pocket. It seemed be silver cigarette lighter. He flicked it open, held it up air, and clicked it. nearest street lamp went out little pop. He clicked it again—the next lamp flickered darkness. Twelve times he clicked Put Outer, until only lights left whole street were two tiny pinpricks distance, which were eyes cat watching him. If anyone looked out their window now, even beady eyed Mrs. Dursley, they wouldn't be able see anything that was happening down pavement. Dumbledore slipped Put Outer back inside his cloak and set off down street toward number four, where he sat down wall next cat. He didn't look it, but after moment he spoke it.
   “Fancy seeing you here, Professor McGonagall.”
   He turned smile tabby, but it had gone. Instead he was smiling rather severe looking woman who was wearing square glasses exactly shape markings cat had had around its eyes. She, too, was wearing cloak, an emerald one. Her black hair was drawn tight bun. She looked distinctly ruffled.
   “How did you know it was me?” she asked.
   “My dear Professor, I've never seen cat sit so stiffly.”
   “You'd be stiff if you'd been sitting brick wall all day,” said Professor McGonagall.
   “All day? When you could have been celebrating? I must have passed dozen feasts and parties my way here.”
   Professor McGonagall sniffed angrily.
   “Oh yes, everyone's celebrating, all right,” she said impatiently. “You'd think they'd be bit more careful, but no—even Muggles have noticed something's going on. It was their news.” She jerked her head back Dursleys' dark living room window. “I heard it. Flocks owls… shooting stars… Well, they're not completely stupid. They were bound notice something. Shooting stars down Kent—I'll bet that was Dedalus Diggle. He never had much sense.”
   “You can't blame them,” said Dumbledore gently. “We've had precious little celebrate eleven years.”
   “I know that,” said Professor McGonagall irritably. “But that's no reason lose our heads. People are being downright careless, out streets broad daylight, not even dressed Muggle clothes, swapping rumors.”
   She threw sharp, sideways glance Dumbledore here, though hoping he was going tell her something, but he didn't, so she went on. “A fine thing it would be if, very day You-Know-Who seems have disappeared last, Muggles found out us all. I suppose he really has gone, Dumbledore?”
   “It certainly seems so,” said Dumbledore. “We have much be thankful for. Would you care lemon drop?”
   “A what?”
   “A lemon drop. They're kind Muggle sweet I'm rather fond of.”
   “No, thank you,” said Professor McGonagall coldly, though she didn't think this was moment lemon drops. “As I say, even if You-Know-Who has gone—”
   “My dear Professor, surely sensible person like yourself can call him by his name? All this ‘You-Know-Who' nonsense—for eleven years I have been trying persuade people call him by his proper name: Voldemort.” Professor McGonagall flinched, but Dumbledore, who was unsticking two lemon drops, seemed not notice. “It all gets so confusing if we keep saying ‘You-Know-Who.' I have never seen any reason be frightened saying Voldemort's name.”
   “I know you haven't”, said Professor McGonagall, sounding half exasperated, half admiring. “But you're different. Everyone knows you're only one You Know—oh, all right, Voldemort, was frightened of.”
   “You flatter me,” said Dumbledore calmly. “Voldemort had powers I will never have.”
   “Only because you're too—well—noble use them.”
   “It's lucky it's dark. I haven't blushed so much since Madam Pomfrey told me she liked my new earmuffs.”
   Professor McGonagall shot sharp look Dumbledore and said, “The owls are nothing next rumors that are flying around. You know what everyone's saying? why he's disappeared? what finally stopped him?”
   It seemed that Professor McGonagall had reached point she was most anxious discuss, real reason she had been waiting cold, hard wall all day, neither cat nor woman had she fixed Dumbledore such piercing stare she did now. It was plain that whatever “everyone” was saying, she was not going believe it until Dumbledore told her it was true. Dumbledore, however, was choosing another lemon drop and did not answer.
   “What they'resaying,” she pressed on, “is that last night Voldemort turned up Godric's Hollow. He went find Potters. rumor is that Lily and James Potter are—are—that they're—dead.”
   Dumbledore bowed his head. Professor McGonagall gasped.
   “Lily and James… I can't believe it… I didn't want believe it… Oh, Albus…”
   Dumbledore reached out and patted her shoulder. “I know… I know…” he said heavily.
   Professor McGonagall's voice trembled she went on. “That's not all. They're saying he tried kill Potter's son, Harry. But—he couldn't. He couldn't kill that little boy. No one knows why, or how, but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter, Voldemort's power somehow broke—and that's why he's gone.”
   Dumbledore nodded glumly.
   “It's—it's true?” faltered Professor McGonagall. “After all he's done… all people he's killed… he couldn't kill little boy? It's just astounding… all things stop him… but how name heaven did Harry survive?”
   “We can only guess,” said Dumbledore. “We may never know.”
   Professor McGonagall pulled out lace handkerchief and dabbed her eyes beneath her spectacles. Dumbledore gave great sniff he took golden watch his pocket and examined it. It was very odd watch. It had twelve hands but no numbers; instead, little planets were moving around edge. It must have made sense Dumbledore, though, because he put it back his pocket and said, “Hagrid's late. I suppose it was he who told you I'd be here, by way?”
   “Yes,” said Professor McGonagall. “And I don't suppose you're going tell me why you're here, all places?”
   “I've come bring Harry his aunt and uncle. They're only family he has left now.”
   “You don't mean—you can't mean people who live here?” cried Professor McGonagall, jumping her feet and pointing number four. “Dumbledore—you can't. I've been watching them all day. You couldn't find two people who are less like us. And they've got this son—I saw him kicking his mother all way up street, screaming sweets. Harry Potter come and live here!”
   “It's best place him,” said Dumbledore firmly. “His aunt and uncle will be able explain everything him when he's older. I've written them letter.”
   “A letter?” repeated Professor McGonagall faintly, sitting back down wall. “Really, Dumbledore, you think you can explain all this letter? These people will never understand him! He'll be famous—a legend—I wouldn't be surprised if today was known Harry Potter day future—there will be books written Harry—every child our world will know his name!”
   “Exactly,” said Dumbledore, looking very seriously over top his half moon glasses. “It would be enough turn any boy's head. Famous before he can walk and talk! Famous something he won't even remember! Can't you see how much better off he'll be, growing up away all that until he's ready take it?”
   Professor McGonagall opened her mouth, changed her mind, swallowed, and then said, “Yes—yes, you're right, course. But how is boy getting here, Dumbledore?” She eyed his cloak suddenly though she thought he might be hiding Harry underneath it.
   “Hagrid's bringing him.”
   “You think it—wise—to trust Hagrid something important this?”
   “I would trust Hagrid my life,” said Dumbledore.
   “I'm not saying his heart isn't right place,” said Professor McGonagall grudgingly, “but you can't pretend he's not careless. He does tend to—what was that?”
   low rumbling sound had broken silence around them. It grew steadily louder they looked up and down street some sign headlight; it swelled roar they both looked up sky—and huge motorcycle fell out air and landed road front them.
   If motorcycle was huge, it was nothing man sitting astride it. He was almost twice tall normal man and least five times wide. He looked simply too big be allowed, and so wild—long tangles bushy black hair and beard hid most his face, he had hands size trash can lids, and his feet their leather boots were like baby dolphins. his vast, muscular arms he was holding bundle blankets.
   “Hagrid,” said Dumbledore, sounding relieved. “At last. And where did you get that motorcycle?”
   “Borrowed it, Professor Dumbledore, sir,” said giant, climbing carefully off motorcycle he spoke. “Young Sirius Black lent it me. I've got him, sir.”
   “No problems, were there?”
   “No, sir—house was almost destroyed, but I got him out all right before Muggles started swarmin' around. He fell asleep we was flyin' over Bristol.”
   Dumbledore and Professor McGonagall bent forward over bundle blankets. Inside, just visible, was baby boy, fast asleep. Under tuft jet black hair over his forehead they could see curiously shaped cut, like bolt lightning.
   “Is that where—?” whispered Professor McGonagall.
   “Yes,” said Dumbledore. “He'll have that scar forever.”
   “Couldn't you do something it, Dumbledore?”
   “Even if I could, I wouldn't. Scars can come handy. I have one myself above my left knee that is perfect map London Underground. Well—give him here, Hagrid—we'd better get this over with.”
   Dumbledore took Harry his arms and turned toward Dursleys' house.
   “Could I—could I say good bye him, sir?” asked Hagrid. He bent his great, shaggy head over Harry and gave him what must have been very scratchy, whiskery kiss. Then, suddenly, Hagrid let out howl like wounded dog.
   “Shhh!” hissed Professor McGonagall, “you'll wake Muggles!”
   “S-s-sorry,” sobbed Hagrid, taking out large, spotted handkerchief and burying his face it. “But I c-c-can't stand it—Lily an' James dead—an' poor little Harry off ter live Muggles—”
   “Yes, yes, it's all very sad, but get grip yourself, Hagrid, or we'll be found,” Professor McGonagall whispered, patting Hagrid gingerly arm Dumbledore stepped over low garden wall and walked front door. He laid Harry gently doorstep, took letter out his cloak, tucked it inside Harry's blankets, and then came back other two. full minute three them stood and looked little bundle; Hagrid's shoulders shook, Professor McGonagall blinked furiously, and twinkling light that usually shone Dumbledore's eyes seemed have gone out.
   “Well,” said Dumbledore finally, “that's that. We've no business staying here. We may well go and join celebrations.”
   “Yeah,” said Hagrid very muffled voice, “I'll be takin' Sirius his bike back. G'night, Professor McGonagall—Professor Dumbledore, sir.”
   Wiping his streaming eyes his jacket sleeve, Hagrid swung himself onto motorcycle and kicked engine life; roar it rose air and off night.
   “I shall see you soon, I expect, Professor McGonagall,” said Dumbledore, nodding her. Professor McGonagall blew her nose reply.
   Dumbledore turned and walked back down street. corner he stopped and took out silver Put-Outer. He clicked it once, and twelve balls light sped back their street lamps so that Privet Drive glowed suddenly orange and he could make out tabby cat slinking around corner other end street. He could just see bundle blankets step number four.
   “Good luck, Harry,” he murmured. He turned his heel and swish his cloak, he was gone.
   breeze ruffled neat hedges Privet Drive, which lay silent and tidy under inky sky, very last place you would expect astonishing things happen. Harry Potter rolled over inside his blankets without waking up. One small hand closed letter beside him and he slept on, not knowing he was special, not knowing he was famous, not knowing he would be woken few hours' time by Mrs. Dursley's scream she opened front door put out milk bottles, nor that he would spend next few weeks being prodded and pinched by his cousin Dudley… He couldn't know that this very moment, people meeting secret all over country were holding up their glasses and saying hushed voices: “To Harry Potter—the boy who lived!”
  

  

   

    2. VANISHING GLASS
   

   Nearly ten years had passed since Dursleys had woken up find their nephew front step, but Privet Drive had hardly changed all. sun rose same tidy front gardens and lit up brass number four Dursleys' front door; it crept their living room, which was almost exactly same it had been night when Mr. Dursley had seen that fateful news report owls. Only photographs mantelpiece really showed how much time had passed. Ten years ago, there had been lots pictures what looked like large pink beach ball wearing different colored bonnets—but Dudley Dursley was no longer baby, and now photographs showed large blond boy riding his first bicycle, carousel fair, playing computer game his father, being hugged and kissed by his mother. room held no sign all that another boy lived house, too.
   Yet Harry Potter was still there, asleep moment, but not long. His Aunt Petunia was awake and it was her shrill voice that made first noise day.
   “Up! Get up! Now!”
   Harry woke start. His aunt rapped door again.
   “Up!” she screeched. Harry heard her walking toward kitchen and then sound frying pan being put stove. He rolled onto his back and tried remember dream he had been having. It had been good one. There had been flying motorcycle it. He had funny feeling he'd had same dream before.
   His aunt was back outside door.
   “Are you up yet?” she demanded.
   “Nearly,” said Harry.
   “Well, get move on, I want you look after bacon. And don't you dare let it burn, I want everything perfect Duddy's birthday.”
   Harry groaned.
   “What did you say?” his aunt snapped through door.
   “Nothing, nothing…”
   Dudley's birthday—how could he have forgotten? Harry got slowly out bed and started looking socks. He found pair under his bed and, after pulling spider off one them, put them on. Harry was used spiders, because cupboard under stairs was full them, and that was where he slept.
   When he was dressed he went down hall kitchen. table was almost hidden beneath all Dudley's birthday presents. It looked though Dudley had gotten new computer he wanted, not mention second television and racing bike. Exactly why Dudley wanted racing bike was mystery Harry, Dudley was very fat and hated exercise—unless course it involved punching somebody. Dudley's favorite punching bag was Harry, but he couldn't often catch him. Harry didn't look it, but he was very fast.
   Perhaps it had something do living dark cupboard, but Harry had always been small and skinny his age. He looked even smaller and skinnier than he really was because all he had wear were old clothes Dudley's, and Dudley was four times bigger than he was. Harry had thin face, knobbly knees, black hair, and bright green eyes. He wore round glasses held together lot Scotch tape because all times Dudley had punched him nose. only thing Harry liked his own appearance was very thin scar his forehead that was shaped like bolt lightning. He had had it long he could remember, and first question he could ever remember asking his Aunt Petunia was how he had gotten it.
   “In car crash when your parents died,” she had said. “And don't ask questions.”
   Don't ask questions—that was first rule quiet life Dursleys.
   Uncle Vernon entered kitchen Harry was turning over bacon.
   “Comb your hair!” he barked, by way morning greeting.
   once week, Uncle Vernon looked over top his newspaper and shouted that Harry needed haircut. Harry must have had more haircuts than rest boys his class put together, but it made no difference, his hair simply grew that way—all over place.
   Harry was frying eggs by time Dudley arrived kitchen his mother. Dudley looked lot like Uncle Vernon. He had large pink face, not much neck, small, watery blue eyes, and thick blond hair that lay smoothly his thick, fat head. Aunt Petunia often said that Dudley looked like baby angel—Harry often said that Dudley looked like pig wig.
   Harry put plates egg and bacon table, which was difficult there wasn't much room. Dudley, meanwhile, was counting his presents. His face fell.
   “Thirty six,” he said, looking up his mother and father. “That's two less than last year.”
   “Darling, you haven't counted Auntie Marge's present, see, it's here under this big one Mommy and Daddy.”
   “All right, thirty seven then,” said Dudley, going red face. Harry, who could see huge Dudley tantrum coming on, began wolfing down his bacon fast possible case Dudley turned table over.
   Aunt Petunia obviously scented danger, too, because she said quickly, “And we'll buy you another two presents while we're out today. How's that, popkin? Two more presents. Is that all right?”
   Dudley thought moment. It looked like hard work. Finally he said slowly, “So I'll have thirty … thirty…”
   “Thirty nine, sweetums,” said Aunt Petunia.
   “Oh.” Dudley sat down heavily and grabbed nearest parcel. “All right then.”
   Uncle Vernon chuckled. “Little tyke wants his money's worth, just like his father. 'Atta boy, Dudley!” He ruffled Dudley's hair.
   that moment telephone rang and Aunt Petunia went answer it while Harry and Uncle Vernon watched Dudley unwrap racing bike, video camera, remote control airplane, sixteen new computer games, and VCR. He was ripping paper off gold wristwatch when Aunt Petunia came back telephone looking both angry and worried.
   “Bad news, Vernon,” she said. “Mrs. Figg's broken her leg. She can't take him.” She jerked her head Harry's direction.
   Dudley's mouth fell open horror, but Harry's heart gave leap. Every year Dudley's birthday, his parents took him and friend out day, adventure parks, hamburger restaurants, or movies. Every year, Harry was left behind Mrs. Figg, mad old lady who lived two streets away. Harry hated it there. whole house smelled cabbage and Mrs. Figg made him look photographs all cats she'd ever owned.
   “Now what?” said Aunt Petunia, looking furiously Harry though he'd planned this. Harry knew he ought feel sorry that Mrs. Figg had broken her leg, but it wasn't easy when he reminded himself it would be whole year before he had look Tibbles, Snowy, Mr. Paws, and Tufty again.
   “We could phone Marge,” Uncle Vernon suggested.
   “Don't be silly, Vernon, she hates boy.”
   Dursleys often spoke Harry like this, though he wasn't there—or rather, though he was something very nasty that couldn't understand them, like slug.
   “What what's her name, your friend—Yvonne?”
   “On vacation Majorca,” snapped Aunt Petunia.
   “You could just leave me here,” Harry put hopefully (he'd be able watch what he wanted television change and maybe even have go Dudley's computer).
   Aunt Petunia looked though she'd just swallowed lemon.
   “And come back and find house ruins?” she snarled.
   “I won't blow up house,” said Harry, but they weren't listening.
   “I suppose we could take him zoo,” said Aunt Petunia slowly, “…and leave him car…”
   “That car's new, he's not sitting it alone…”
   Dudley began cry loudly. fact, he wasn't really crying—it had been years since he'd really cried—but he knew that if he screwed up his face and wailed, his mother would give him anything he wanted.
   “Dinky Duddydums, don't cry, Mummy won't let him spoil your special day!” she cried, flinging her arms around him.
   “I… don't… want… him… t-t-to come!” Dudley yelled between huge, pretend sobs. “He always sp-spoils everything!” He shot Harry nasty grin through gap his mother's arms.
   Just then, doorbell rang—“Oh, good Lord, they're here!” said Aunt Petunia frantically—and moment later, Dudley's best friend, Piers Polkiss, walked his mother. Piers was scrawny boy face like rat. He was usually one who held people's arms behind their backs while Dudley hit them. Dudley stopped pretending cry once.
   Half an hour later, Harry, who couldn't believe his luck, was sitting back Dursleys' car Piers and Dudley, way zoo first time his life. His aunt and uncle hadn't been able think anything else do him, but before they'd left, Uncle Vernon had taken Harry aside.
   “I'm warning you,” he had said, putting his large purple face right up close Harry's, “I'm warning you now, boy—any funny business, anything all—and you'll be that cupboard now until Christmas.”
   “I'm not going do anything,” said Harry, “honestly…”
   But Uncle Vernon didn't believe him. No one ever did.
   problem was, strange things often happened around Harry and it was just no good telling Dursleys he didn't make them happen.
   Once, Aunt Petunia, tired Harry coming back barbers looking though he hadn't been all, had taken pair kitchen scissors and cut his hair so short he was almost bald except his bangs, which she left “to hide that horrible scar.” Dudley had laughed himself silly Harry, who spent sleepless night imagining school next day, where he was already laughed his baggy clothes and taped glasses. Next morning, however, he had gotten up find his hair exactly it had been before Aunt Petunia had sheared it off. He had been given week his cupboard this, even though he had tried explain that he couldn't explain how it had grown back so quickly.
   Another time, Aunt Petunia had been trying force him revolting old sweater Dudley's (brown orange puff balls)—The harder she tried pull it over his head, smaller it seemed become, until finally it might have fitted hand puppet, but certainly wouldn't fit Harry. Aunt Petunia had decided it must have shrunk wash and, his great relief, Harry wasn't punished.
   other hand, he'd gotten terrible trouble being found roof school kitchens. Dudley's gang had been chasing him usual when, much Harry's surprise anyone else's, there he was sitting chimney. Dursleys had received very angry letter Harry's headmistress telling them Harry had been climbing school buildings. But all he'd tried do (as he shouted Uncle Vernon through locked door his cupboard) was jump behind big trash cans outside kitchen doors. Harry supposed that wind must have caught him mid-jump.
   But today, nothing was going go wrong. It was even worth being Dudley and Piers be spending day somewhere that wasn't school, his cupboard, or Mrs. Figg's cabbage smelling living room.
   While he drove, Uncle Vernon complained Aunt Petunia. He liked complain things: people work, Harry, council, Harry, bank, and Harry were just few his favorite subjects. This morning, it was motorcycles.
   “…roaring along like maniacs, young hoodlums,” he said, motorcycle overtook them.
   “I had dream motorcycle,” said Harry, remembering suddenly. “It was flying.”
   Uncle Vernon nearly crashed car front. He turned right around his seat and yelled Harry, his face like gigantic beet mustache: “MOTORCYCLES DON'T FLY!”
   Dudley and Piers sniggered.
   “I know they don't,” said Harry. “It was only dream.”
   But he wished he hadn't said anything. If there was one thing Dursleys hated even more than his asking questions, it was his talking anything acting way it shouldn't, no matter if it was dream or even cartoon—they seemed think he might get dangerous ideas.
   It was very sunny Saturday and zoo was crowded families. Dursleys bought Dudley and Piers large chocolate ice creams entrance and then, because smiling lady van had asked Harry what he wanted before they could hurry him away, they bought him cheap lemon ice pop. It wasn't bad, either, Harry thought, licking it they watched gorilla scratching its head who looked remarkably like Dudley, except that it wasn't blond.
   Harry had best morning he'd had long time. He was careful walk little way apart Dursleys so that Dudley and Piers, who were starting get bored animals by lunchtime, wouldn't fall back their favorite hobby hitting him. They ate zoo restaurant, and when Dudley had tantrum because his knickerbocker glory didn't have enough ice cream top, Uncle Vernon bought him another one and Harry was allowed finish first.
   Harry felt, afterward, that he should have known it was all too good last.
   After lunch they went reptile house. It was cool and dark there, lit windows all along walls. Behind glass, all sorts lizards and snakes were crawling and slithering over bits wood and stone. Dudley and Piers wanted see huge, poisonous cobras and thick, man crushing pythons. Dudley quickly found largest snake place. It could have wrapped its body twice around Uncle Vernon's car and crushed it trash can—but moment it didn't look mood. fact, it was fast asleep.
   Dudley stood his nose pressed against glass, staring glistening brown coils.
   “Make it move,” he whined his father. Uncle Vernon tapped glass, but snake didn't budge.
   “Do it again,” Dudley ordered. Uncle Vernon rapped glass smartly his knuckles, but snake just snoozed on.
   “This is boring,” Dudley moaned. He shuffled away.
   Harry moved front tank and looked intently snake. He wouldn't have been surprised if it had died boredom itself—no company except stupid people drumming their fingers glass trying disturb it all day long. It was worse than having cupboard bedroom, where only visitor was Aunt Petunia hammering door wake you up; least he got visit rest house.
   snake suddenly opened its beady eyes. Slowly, very slowly, it raised its head until its eyes were level Harry's.
   It winked.
   Harry stared. Then he looked quickly around see if anyone was watching. They weren't. He looked back snake and winked, too.
   snake jerked its head toward Uncle Vernon and Dudley, then raised its eyes ceiling. It gave Harry look that said quite plainly:
   “I get that all time.”
   “I know,” Harry murmured through glass, though he wasn't sure snake could hear him. “It must be really annoying.”
   snake nodded vigorously.
   “Where do you come from, anyway?” Harry asked.
   snake jabbed its tail little sign next glass. Harry peered it.
   
    Boa Constrictor, Brazil.
   
   “Was it nice there?”
   boa constrictor jabbed its tail sign again and Harry read on: This specimen was bred zoo. “Oh, I see—so you've never been Brazil?”
   snake shook its head, deafening shout behind Harry made both them jump.
   “DUDLEY! MR. DURSLEY! COME AND LOOK THIS SNAKE! YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT IT'S DOING!”
   Dudley came waddling toward them fast he could.
   “Out way, you,” he said, punching Harry ribs. Caught by surprise, Harry fell hard concrete floor. What came next happened so fast no one saw how it happened—one second, Piers and Dudley were leaning right up close glass, next, they had leapt back howls horror.
   Harry sat up and gasped; glass front boa constrictor's tank had vanished. great snake was uncoiling itself rapidly, slithering out onto floor. People throughout reptile house screamed and started running exits.
   snake slid swiftly past him, Harry could have sworn low, hissing voice said, “Brazil, here I come… Thanksss, amigo.”
   keeper reptile house was shock.
   “But glass,” he kept saying, “where did glass go?”
   zoo director himself made Aunt Petunia cup strong, sweet tea while he apologized over and over again. Piers and Dudley could only gibber. far Harry had seen, snake hadn't done anything except snap playfully their heels it passed, but by time they were all back Uncle Vernon's car, Dudley was telling them how it had nearly bitten off his leg, while Piers was swearing it had tried squeeze him death. But worst all, Harry least, was Piers calming down enough say, “Harry was talking it, weren't you, Harry?”
   Uncle Vernon waited until Piers was safely out house before starting Harry. He was so angry he could hardly speak. He managed say, “Go—cupboard—stay—no meals,” before he collapsed chair, and Aunt Petunia had run and get him large brandy.
   Harry lay his dark cupboard much later, wishing he had watch. He didn't know what time it was and he couldn't be sure Dursleys were asleep yet. Until they were, he couldn't risk sneaking kitchen some food.
   He'd lived Dursleys almost ten years, ten miserable years, long he could remember, ever since he'd been baby and his parents had died that car crash. He couldn't remember being car when his parents had died. Sometimes, when he strained his memory during long hours his cupboard, he came up strange vision: blinding flash green light and burning pain his forehead. This, he supposed, was crash, though he couldn't imagine where all green light came from. He couldn't remember his parents all. His aunt and uncle never spoke them, and course he was forbidden ask questions. There were no photographs them house.
   When he had been younger, Harry had dreamed and dreamed some unknown relation coming take him away, but it had never happened; Dursleys were his only family. Yet sometimes he thought (or maybe hoped) that strangers street seemed know him. Very strange strangers they were, too. tiny man violet top hat had bowed him once while out shopping Aunt Petunia and Dudley. After asking Harry furiously if he knew man, Aunt Petunia had rushed them out shop without buying anything. wild looking old woman dressed all green had waved merrily him once bus. bald man very long purple coat had actually shaken his hand street other day and then walked away without word. weirdest thing all these people was way they seemed vanish second Harry tried get closer look.
   school, Harry had no one. Everybody knew that Dudley's gang hated that odd Harry Potter his baggy old clothes and broken glasses, and nobody liked disagree Dudley's gang.
  

  

   

    3. LETTERS NO ONE
   

   escape Brazilian boa constrictor earned Harry his longest ever punishment. By time he was allowed out his cupboard again, summer holidays had started and Dudley had already broken his new video camera, crashed his remote control airplane, and, first time out his racing bike, knocked down old Mrs. Figg she crossed Privet Drive her crutches.
   Harry was glad school was over, but there was no escaping Dudley's gang, who visited house every single day. Piers, Dennis, Malcolm, and Gordon were all big and stupid, but Dudley was biggest and stupidest lot, he was leader. rest them were all quite happy join Dudley's favorite sport: Harry Hunting.
   This was why Harry spent much time possible out house, wandering around and thinking end holidays, where he could see tiny ray hope. When September came he would be going off secondary school and, first time his life, he wouldn't be Dudley. Dudley had been accepted Uncle Vernon's old private school, Smeltings. Piers Polkiss was going there too. Harry, other hand, was going Stonewall High, local public school. Dudley thought this was very funny.
   “They stuff people's heads down toilet first day Stonewall,” he told Harry. “Want come upstairs and practice?”
   “No, thanks,” said Harry. “The poor toilet's never had anything horrible your head down it—it might be sick.” Then he ran, before Dudley could work out what he'd said.
   One day July, Aunt Petunia took Dudley London buy his Smeltings uniform, leaving Harry Mrs. Figg's. Mrs. Figg wasn't bad usual. It turned out she'd broken her leg tripping over one her cats, and she didn't seem quite fond them before. She let Harry watch television and gave him bit chocolate cake that tasted though she'd had it several years.
   That evening, Dudley paraded around living room family his brand new uniform. Smeltings' boys wore maroon tailcoats, orange knickerbockers, and flat straw hats called boaters. They also carried knobbly sticks, used hitting each other while teachers weren't looking. This was supposed be good training later life.
   he looked Dudley his new knickerbockers, Uncle Vernon said gruffly that it was proudest moment his life. Aunt Petunia burst tears and said she couldn't believe it was her Ickle Dudleykins, he looked so handsome and grown up. Harry didn't trust himself speak. He thought two his ribs might already have cracked trying not laugh.
   
* * *

   There was horrible smell kitchen next morning when Harry went breakfast. It seemed be coming large metal tub sink. He went have look. tub was full what looked like dirty rags swimming gray water.
   “What's this?” he asked Aunt Petunia. Her lips tightened they always did if he dared ask question.
   “Your new school uniform,” she said.
   Harry looked bowl again.
   “Oh,” he said, “I didn't realize it had be so wet.”
   “Don't be stupid,” snapped Aunt Petunia. “I'm dyeing some Dudley's old things gray you. It'll look just like everyone else's when I've finished.”
   Harry seriously doubted this, but thought it best not argue. He sat down table and tried not think how he was going look his first day Stonewall High—like he was wearing bits old elephant skin, probably.
   Dudley and Uncle Vernon came in, both wrinkled noses because smell Harry's new uniform. Uncle Vernon opened his newspaper usual and Dudley banged his Smelting stick, which he carried everywhere, table.
   They heard click mail slot and flop letters doormat.
   “Get mail, Dudley,” said Uncle Vernon behind his paper.
   “Make Harry get it.”
   “Get mail, Harry.”
   “Make Dudley get it.”
   “Poke him your Smelting stick, Dudley.”
   Harry dodged Smelting stick and went get mail. Three things lay doormat: postcard Uncle Vernon's sister Marge, who was vacationing Isle Wight, brown envelope that looked like bill, and—a letter Harry. Harry picked it up and stared it, his heart twanging like giant elastic band. No one, ever, his whole life, had written him. Who would? He had no friends, no other relatives—he didn't belong library, so he'd never even got rude notes asking books back. Yet here it was, letter, addressed so plainly there could be no mistake:
   
    Mr. H. Potter
    Cupboard under Stairs
    4 Privet Drive
    Little Whinging
    Surrey
   
   envelope was thick and heavy, made yellowish parchment, and address was written emerald green ink. There was no stamp.
   Turning envelope over, his hand trembling, Harry saw purple wax seal bearing coat arms; lion, an eagle, badger, and snake surrounding large letter H.
   “Hurry up, boy!” shouted Uncle Vernon kitchen. “What are you doing, checking letter bombs?” He chuckled his own joke.
   Harry went back kitchen, still staring his letter. He handed Uncle Vernon bill and postcard, sat down, and slowly began open yellow envelope.
   Uncle Vernon ripped open bill, snorted disgust, and flipped over postcard.
   “Marge's ill,” he informed Aunt Petunia. “Ate funny whelk.”
   “Dad!” said Dudley suddenly. “Dad, Harry's got something!”
   Harry was point unfolding his letter, which was written same heavy parchment envelope, when it was jerked sharply out his hand by Uncle Vernon.
   “That's mine!” said Harry, trying snatch it back.
   “Who'd be writing you?” sneered Uncle Vernon, shaking letter open one hand and glancing it. His face went red green faster than set traffic lights. And it didn't stop there. Within seconds it was grayish white old porridge.
   “P-P-Petunia!” he gasped.
   Dudley tried grab letter read it, but Uncle Vernon held it high out his reach. Aunt Petunia took it curiously and read first line. moment it looked though she might faint. She clutched her throat and made choking noise.
   “Vernon! Oh my goodness—Vernon!”
   They stared each other, seeming have forgotten that Harry and Dudley were still room. Dudley wasn't used being ignored. He gave his father sharp tap head his Smelting stick.
   “I want read that letter,” he said loudly.
   “I want read it,” said Harry furiously, “as it's mine.”
   “Get out, both you,” croaked Uncle Vernon, stuffing letter back inside its envelope.
   Harry didn't move.
   “I WANT MY LETTER!” he shouted.
   “Let me see it!” demanded Dudley.
   “OUT!” roared Uncle Vernon, and he took both Harry and Dudley by scruffs their necks and threw them hall, slamming kitchen door behind them. Harry and Dudley promptly had furious but silent fight over who would listen keyhole; Dudley won, so Harry, his glasses dangling one ear, lay flat his stomach listen crack between door and floor.
   “Vernon,” Aunt Petunia was saying quivering voice, “look address—how could they possibly know where he sleeps? You don't think they're watching house?”
   “Watching—spying—might be following us,” muttered Uncle Vernon wildly.
   “But what should we do, Vernon? Should we write back? Tell them we don't want—”
   Harry could see Uncle Vernon's shiny black shoes pacing up and down kitchen.
   “No,” he said finally. “No, we'll ignore it. If they don't get an answer… Yes, that's best… we won't do anything…”
   “But—”
   “I'm not having one house, Petunia! Didn't we swear when we took him we'd stamp out that dangerous nonsense?”
   That evening when he got back work, Uncle Vernon did something he'd never done before; he visited Harry his cupboard.
   “Where's my letter?” said Harry, moment Uncle Vernon had squeezed through door. “Who's writing me?”
   “No one. it was addressed you by mistake,” said Uncle Vernon shortly. “I have burned it.”
   “It was not mistake,” said Harry angrily, “it had my cupboard it.”
   “SILENCE!” yelled Uncle Vernon, and couple spiders fell ceiling. He took few deep breaths and then forced his face smile, which looked quite painful.
   “Er—yes, Harry—about this cupboard. Your aunt and I have been thinking… you're really getting bit big it… we think it might be nice if you moved Dudley's second bedroom.”
   “Why?” said Harry.
   “Don't ask questions!” snapped his uncle. “Take this stuff upstairs, now.”
   Dursleys' house had four bedrooms: one Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia, one visitors (usually Uncle Vernon's sister, Marge), one where Dudley slept, and one where Dudley kept all toys and things that wouldn't fit his first bedroom. It only took Harry one trip upstairs move everything he owned cupboard this room. He sat down bed and stared around him. Nearly everything here was broken. month old video camera was lying top small, working tank Dudley had once driven over next door neighbor's dog; corner was Dudley's first ever television set, which he'd put his foot through when his favorite program had been canceled; there was large birdcage, which had once held parrot that Dudley had swapped school real air rifle, which was up shelf end all bent because Dudley had sat it. Other shelves were full books. They were only things room that looked though they'd never been touched.
   downstairs came sound Dudley bawling his mother, “I don't want him there… I need that room… make him get out…”
   Harry sighed and stretched out bed. Yesterday he'd have given anything be up here. Today he'd rather be back his cupboard that letter than up here without it.
   Next morning breakfast, everyone was rather quiet. Dudley was shock. He'd screamed, whacked his father his Smelting stick, been sick purpose, kicked his mother, and thrown his tortoise through greenhouse roof, and he still didn't have his room back. Harry was thinking this time yesterday and bitterly wishing he'd opened letter hall. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia kept looking each other darkly.
   When mail arrived, Uncle Vernon, who seemed be trying be nice Harry, made Dudley go and get it. They heard him banging things his Smelting stick all way down hall. Then he shouted, “There's another one! ‘Mr. H. Potter, Smallest Bedroom, 4 Privet Drive—'”
   strangled cry, Uncle Vernon leapt his seat and ran down hall, Harry right behind him. Uncle Vernon had wrestle Dudley ground get letter him, which was made difficult by fact that Harry had grabbed Uncle Vernon around neck behind. After minute confused fighting, which everyone got hit lot by Smelting stick, Uncle Vernon straightened up, gasping breath, Harry's letter clutched his hand.
   “Go your cupboard—I mean, your bedroom,” he wheezed Harry. “Dudley—go—just go.”
   Harry walked round and round his new room. Someone knew he had moved out his cupboard and they seemed know he hadn't received his first letter. Surely that meant they'd try again? And this time he'd make sure they didn't fail. He had plan.
   repaired alarm clock rang six o'clock next morning. Harry turned it off quickly and dressed silently. He mustn't wake Dursleys. He stole downstairs without turning any lights.
   He was going wait postman corner Privet Drive and get letters number four first. His heart hammered he crept across dark hall toward front door—
   “AAAAARRRGH!”
   Harry leapt air; he'd trodden something big and squashy doormat—something alive!
   Lights clicked upstairs and his horror Harry realized that big, squashy something had been his uncle's face. Uncle Vernon had been lying foot front door sleeping bag, clearly making sure that Harry didn't do exactly what he'd been trying do. He shouted Harry half an hour and then told him go and make cup tea. Harry shuffled miserably off kitchen and by time he got back, mail had arrived, right Uncle Vernon's lap. Harry could see three letters addressed green ink.
   “I want—” he began, but Uncle Vernon was tearing letters pieces before his eyes.
   Uncle Vernon didnt go work that day. He stayed home and nailed up mail slot.
   “See,” he explained Aunt Petunia through mouthful nails, “if they can't deliver them they'll just give up.”
   “I'm not sure that'll work, Vernon.”
   “Oh, these people's minds work strange ways, Petunia, they're not like you and me,” said Uncle Vernon, trying knock nail piece fruitcake Aunt Petunia had just brought him.
   Friday, no less than twelve letters arrived Harry. they couldn't go through mail slot they had been pushed under door, slotted through sides, and few even forced through small window downstairs bathroom.
   Uncle Vernon stayed home again. After burning all letters, he got out hammer and nails and boarded up cracks around front and back doors so no one could go out. He hummed “Tiptoe Through Tulips” he worked, and jumped small noises.
   Saturday, things began get out hand. Twenty four letters Harry found their way house, rolled up and hidden inside each two dozen eggs that their very confused milkman had handed Aunt Petunia through living room window. While Uncle Vernon made furious telephone calls post office and dairy trying find someone complain to, Aunt Petunia shredded letters her food processor.
   “Who earth wants talk you this badly?” Dudley asked Harry amazement.
   
* * *

   Sunday morning, Uncle Vernon sat down breakfast table looking tired and rather ill, but happy.
   “No post Sundays,” he reminded them cheerfully he spread marmalade his newspapers, “no damn letters today—”
   Something came whizzing down kitchen chimney he spoke and caught him sharply back head. Next moment, thirty or forty letters came pelting out fireplace like bullets. Dursleys ducked, but Harry leapt air trying catch one—
   “Out! OUT!”
   Uncle Vernon seized Harry around waist and threw him hall. When Aunt Petunia and Dudley had run out their arms over their faces, Uncle Vernon slammed door shut. They could hear letters still streaming room, bouncing off walls and floor.
   “That does it,” said Uncle Vernon, trying speak calmly but pulling great tufts out his mustache same time. “I want you all back here five minutes ready leave. We're going away. Just pack some clothes. No arguments!”
   He looked so dangerous half his mustache missing that no one dared argue. Ten minutes later they had wrenched their way through boarded up doors and were car, speeding toward highway. Dudley was sniffling back seat; his father had hit him round head holding them up while he tried pack his television, VCR, and computer his sports bag.
   They drove. And they drove. Even Aunt Petunia didn't dare ask where they were going. Every now and then Uncle Vernon would take sharp turn and drive opposite direction while.
   “Shake 'em off… shake 'em off,” he would mutter whenever he did this.
   They didn't stop eat or drink all day. By nightfall Dudley was howling. He'd never had such bad day his life. He was hungry, he'd missed five television programs he'd wanted see, and he'd never gone so long without blowing up an alien his computer.
   Uncle Vernon stopped last outside gloomy looking hotel outskirts big city. Dudley and Harry shared room twin beds and damp, musty sheets. Dudley snored but Harry stayed awake, sitting windowsill, staring down lights passing cars and wondering…
   They ate stale cornflakes and cold tinned tomatoes toast breakfast next day. They had just finished when owner hotel came over their table.
   “'Scuse me, but is one you Mr. H. Potter? Only I got an 'undred these front desk.”
   She held up letter so they could read green ink address:
   
    Mr. H. Potter
    Room 17
    Railview Hotel
    Cokeworth
   
   Harry made grab letter but Uncle Vernon knocked his hand out way. woman stared.
   “I'll take them,” said Uncle Vernon, standing up quickly and following her dining room.
   
* * *

   “Wouldn't it be better just go home, dear?” Aunt Petunia suggested timidly, hours later, but Uncle Vernon didn't seem hear her. Exactly what he was looking for, none them knew. He drove them middle forest, got out, looked around, shook his head, got back car, and off they went again. same thing happened middle plowed field, halfway across suspension bridge, and top multilevel parking garage.
   “Daddy's gone mad, hasn't he?” Dudley asked Aunt Petunia dully late that afternoon. Uncle Vernon had parked coast, locked them all inside car, and disappeared.
   It started rain. Great drops beat roof car. Dud ley sniveled.
   “It's Monday,” he told his mother. “The Great Humberto's tonight. I want stay somewhere television.”
   Monday. This reminded Harry something. If it was Monday—and you could usually count Dudley know days week, because television—then tomorrow, Tuesday, was Harry's eleventh birthday. course, his birthdays were never exactly fun—last year, Dursleys had given him coat hanger and pair Uncle Vernon's old socks. Still, you weren't eleven every day.
   Uncle Vernon was back and he was smiling. He was also carrying long, thin package and didn't answer Aunt Petunia when she asked what he'd bought.
   “Found perfect place!” he said. “Come on! Everyone out!”
   It was very cold outside car. Uncle Vernon was pointing what looked like large rock way out sea. Perched top rock was most miserable little shack you could imagine. One thing was certain, there was no television there.
   “Storm forecast tonight!” said Uncle Vernon gleefully, clapping his hands together. “And this gentleman's kindly agreed lend us his boat!”
   toothless old man came ambling up them, pointing, rather wicked grin, an old rowboat bobbing iron gray water below them.
   “I've already got us some rations,” said Uncle Vernon, “so all aboard!”
   It was freezing boat. Icy sea spray and rain crept down their necks and chilly wind whipped their faces. After what seemed like hours they reached rock, where Uncle Vernon, slipping and sliding, led way broken down house.
   inside was horrible; it smelled strongly seaweed, wind whistled through gaps wooden walls, and fireplace was damp and empty. There were only two rooms.
   Uncle Vernon's rations turned out be bag chips each and four bananas. He tried start fire but empty chip bags just smoked and shriveled up.
   “Could do some those letters now, eh?” he said cheerfully.
   He was very good mood. Obviously he thought nobody stood chance reaching them here storm deliver mail. Harry privately agreed, though thought didn't cheer him up all.
   night fell, promised storm blew up around them. Spray high waves splattered walls hut and fierce wind rattled filthy windows. Aunt Petunia found few moldy blankets second room and made up bed Dudley moth eaten sofa. She and Uncle Vernon went off lumpy bed next door, and Harry was left find softest bit floor he could and curl up under thinnest, most ragged blanket.
   storm raged more and more ferociously night went on. Harry couldn't sleep. He shivered and turned over, trying get comfortable, his stomach rumbling hunger. Dudley's snores were drowned by low rolls thunder that started near midnight. lighted dial Dudley's watch, which was dangling over edge sofa his fat wrist, told Harry he'd be eleven ten minutes' time. He lay and watched his birthday tick nearer, wondering if Dursleys would remember all, wondering where letter writer was now.
   Five minutes go. Harry heard something creak outside. He hoped roof wasn't going fall in, although he might be warmer if it did. Four minutes go. Maybe house Privet Drive would be so full letters when they got back that he'd be able steal one somehow.
   Three minutes go. Was that sea, slapping hard rock like that? And (two minutes go) what was that funny crunching noise? Was rock crumbling sea?
   One minute go and he'd be eleven. Thirty seconds… twenty… ten… nine—maybe he'd wake Dudley up, just annoy him—three… two… one…
   BOOM.
   whole shack shivered and Harry sat bolt upright, staring door. Someone was outside, knocking come in.
  

  

   

    4. KEEPER KEYS
   

   BOOM. They knocked again. Dudley jerked awake. “Where's cannon?” he said stupidly.
   There was crash behind them and Uncle Vernon came skidding room. He was holding rifle his hands—now they knew what had been long, thin package he had brought them.
   “Who's there?” he shouted. “I warn you—I'm armed!”
   There was pause. Then—
   SMASH!
   door was hit such force that it swung clean off its hinges and deafening crash landed flat floor.
   giant man was standing doorway. His face was almost completely hidden by long, shaggy mane hair and wild, tangled beard, but you could make out his eyes, glinting like black beetles under all hair.
   giant squeezed his way hut, stooping so that his head just brushed ceiling. He bent down, picked up door, and fitted it easily back its frame. noise storm outside dropped little. He turned look them all.
   “Couldn't make us cup o' tea, could yeh? It's not been an easy journey…”
   He strode over sofa where Dudley sat frozen fear.
   “Budge up, yeh great lump,” said stranger.
   Dudley squeaked and ran hide behind his mother, who was crouching, terrified, behind Uncle Vernon.
   “An' here's Harry!” said giant.
   Harry looked up fierce, wild, shadowy face and saw that beetle eyes were crinkled smile.
   “Las' time I saw you, you was only baby,” said giant. “Yeh look lot like yet dad, but yeh've got yet mom's eyes.”
   Uncle Vernon made funny rasping noise.
   “I demand that you leave once, sir!” he said. “You are breaking and entering!”
   “Ah, shut up, Dursley, yeh great prune,” said giant; he reached over back sofa, jerked gun out Uncle Vernon's hands, bent it knot easily if it had been made rubber, and threw it corner room.
   Uncle Vernon made another funny noise, like mouse being trodden on.
   “Anyway—Harry,” said giant, turning his back Dursleys, “a very happy birthday yeh. Got summat fer yeh here—I mighta sat it some point, but it'll taste all right.”
   an inside pocket his black overcoat he pulled slightly squashed box. Harry opened it trembling fingers. Inside was large, sticky chocolate cake Happy Birthday Harry written it green icing.
   Harry looked up giant. He meant say thank you, but words got lost way his mouth, and what he said instead was, “Who are you?”
   giant chuckled.
   “True, I haven't introduced meself. Rubeus Hagrid, Keeper Keys and Grounds Hogwarts.”
   He held out an enormous hand and shook Harry's whole arm.
   “What that tea then, eh?” he said, rubbing his hands together. “I'd not say no ter summat stronger if yeh've got it, mind.”
   His eyes fell empty grate shriveled chip bags it and he snorted. He bent down over fireplace; they couldn't see what he was doing but when he drew back second later, there was roaring fire there. It filled whole damp hut flickering light and Harry felt warmth wash over him though he'd sunk hot bath.
   giant sat back down sofa, which sagged under his weight, and began taking all sorts things out pockets his coat: copper kettle, squashy package sausages, poker, teapot, several chipped mugs, and bottle some amber liquid that he took swig before starting make tea. Soon hut was full sound and smell sizzling sausage. Nobody said thing while giant was working, but he slid first six fat, juicy, slightly burnt sausages poker, Dudley fidgeted little. Uncle Vernon said sharply, “Don't touch anything he gives you, Dudley.”
   giant chuckled darkly.
   “Yer great puddin' son don' need fattenin' anymore, Dursley, don' worry.”
   He passed sausages Harry, who was so hungry he had never tasted anything so wonderful, but he still couldn't take his eyes off giant. Finally, nobody seemed explain anything, he said, “I'm sorry, but I still don't really know who you are.”
   giant took gulp tea and wiped his mouth back his hand.
   “Call me Hagrid,” he said, “everyone does. An' like I told yeh, I'm Keeper Keys Hogwarts—yeh'll know all Hogwarts, o' course.”
   “Er—no,” said Harry.
   Hagrid looked shocked.
   “Sorry,” Harry said quickly.
   “Sorry?” barked Hagrid, turning stare Dursleys, who shrank back shadows. “It' s them should be sorry! I knew yeh weren't gettin' yer letters but I never thought yeh wouldn't even know abou' Hogwarts, fer cryin' out loud! Did yeh never wonder where yet parents learned it all?”
   “All what?” asked Harry.
   “ALL WHAT?” Hagrid thundered. “Now wait jus' one second!”
   He had leapt his feet. his anger he seemed fill whole hut. Dursleys were cowering against wall.
   “Do you mean ter tell me,” he growled Dursleys, “that this boy—this boy!—knows nothin' abou'—about ANYTHING?”
   Harry thought this was going bit far. He had been school, after all, and his marks weren't bad.
   “I know some things,” he said. “I can, you know, do math and stuff.” But Hagrid simply waved his hand and said, “About our world, I mean. Your world. My world. Yer parents' world.”
   “What world?”
   Hagrid looked if he was explode.
   “DURSLEY!” he boomed.
   Uncle Vernon, who had gone very pale, whispered something that sounded like “Mimblewimble.” Hagrid stared wildly Harry.
   “But yeh must know yet mom and dad,” he said. “I mean, they're famous. You're famous.”
   “What? My—my mom and dad weren't famous, were they?”
   “Yeh don' know… yeh don' know…” Hagrid ran his fingers through his hair, fixing Harry bewildered stare.
   “Yeh don' know what yeh are?” he said finally.
   Uncle Vernon suddenly found his voice.
   “Stop!” he commanded. “Stop right there, sit! I forbid you tell boy anything!”
   braver man than Vernon Dursley would have quailed under furious look Hagrid now gave him; when Hagrid spoke, his every syllable trembled rage.
   “You never told him? Never told him what was letter Dumbledore left fer him? I was there! I saw Dumbledore leave it, Dursley! An' you've kept it him all these years?”
   “Kept what me?” said Harry eagerly.
   “STOP! I FORBID YOU!” yelled Uncle Vernon panic.
   Aunt Petunia gave gasp horror.
   “Ah, go boil yet heads, both yeh,” said Hagrid. “Harry—yer wizard.”
   There was silence inside hut. Only sea and whistling wind could be heard.
   “I'm what?” gasped Harry.
   “A wizard, o' course,” said Hagrid, sitting back down sofa, which groaned and sank even lower, “an' thumpin' good'un, I'd say, once yeh've been trained up bit. mum an' dad like yours, what else would yeh be? An' I reckon it's abou' time yeh read yer letter.”
   Harry stretched out his hand last take yellowish envelope, addressed emerald green Mr. H. Potter, Floor, Hut Rock, Sea. He pulled out letter and read:
   
    HOGWARTS SCHOOL WITCHCRAFT and WIZARDRY
    Headmaster: ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
    (Order Merlin, First Class, Grand Sorc., Chf. Warlock, Supreme Mugwump, International Confed. Wizards)
    

    Dear Mr. Potter,
    We are pleased inform you that you have been accepted Hogwarts School Witchcraft and Wizardry. Please find enclosed list all necessary books and equipment.
    Term begins September 1. We await your owl by no later than July 31.
    Yours sincerely,
    Minerva McGonagall,
    Deputy Headmistress
   
   Questions exploded inside Harry's head like fireworks and he couldn't decide which ask first. After few minutes he stammered, “What does it mean, they await my owl?”
   “Gallopin' Gorgons, that reminds me,” said Hagrid, clapping hand his forehead enough force knock over cart horse, and yet another pocket inside his overcoat he pulled an owl—a real, live, rather ruffled looking owl—a long quill, and roll parchment. his tongue between his teeth he scribbled note that Harry could read upside down:
   
    Dear Professor Dumbledore,
    Given Harry his letter.
    Taking him buy his things tomorrow.
    Weather's horrible. Hope you're well.
    Hagrid
   
   Hagrid rolled up note, gave it owl, which clamped it its beak, went door, and threw owl out storm. Then he came back and sat down though this was normal talking telephone.
   Harry realized his mouth was open and closed it quickly.
   “Where was I?” said Hagrid, but that moment, Uncle Vernon, still ashen faced but looking very angry, moved firelight.
   “He's not going,” he said.
   Hagrid grunted.
   “I'd like ter see great Muggle like you stop him,” he said.
   “A what?” said Harry, interested.
   “A Muggle,” said Hagrid, “it's what we call nonmagic folk like them. An' it's your bad luck you grew up family o' biggest Muggles I ever laid eyes on.”
   “We swore when we took him we'd put stop that rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon, “swore we'd stamp it out him! Wizard indeed!”
   “You knew?” said Harry. “You knew I'm a—a wizard?”
   “Knew!” shrieked Aunt Petunia suddenly. “Knew! course we knew! How could you not be, my dratted sister being what she was? Oh, she got letter just like that and disappeared off that—that school—and came home every vacation her pockets full frog spawn, turning teacups rats. I was only one who saw her what she was—a freak! But my mother and father, oh no, it was Lily this and Lily that, they were proud having witch family!”
   She stopped draw deep breath and then went ranting on. It seemed she had been wanting say all this years.
   “Then she met that Potter school and they left and got married and had you, and course I knew you'd be just same, just strange, just as—as—abnormal—and then, if you please, she went and got herself blown up and we got landed you!”
   Harry had gone very white. soon he found his voice he said, “Blown up? You told me they died car crash!”
   “CAR CRASH!” roared Hagrid, jumping up so angrily that Dursleys scuttled back their corner. “How could car crash kill Lily an' James Potter? It's an outrage! scandal! Harry Potter not knowin' his own story when every kid our world knows his name!”
   “But why? What happened?” Harry asked urgently.
   anger faded Hagrid's face. He looked suddenly anxious.
   “I never expected this,” he said, low, worried voice. “I had no idea, when Dumbledore told me there might be trouble gettin' hold yeh, how much yeh didn't know. Ah, Harry, I don' know if I'm right person ter tell yeh—but someone's gotta—yeh can't go off ter Hogwarts not knowin'.”
   He threw dirty look Dursleys.
   “Well, it's best yeh know much I can tell yeh—mind, I can't tell yeh everythin', it's great myst'ry, parts it…”
   He sat down, stared fire few seconds, and then said, “It begins, I suppose, with—with person called—but it's incredible yeh don't know his name, everyone our world knows—”
   “Who?”
   “Well—I don' like sayin' name if I can help it. No one does.”
   “Why not?”
   “Gulpin' gargoyles, Harry, people are still scared. Blimey, this is difficult. See, there was this wizard who went… bad. bad you could go. Worse. Worse than worse. His name was…”
   Hagrid gulped, but no words came out.
   “Could you write it down?” Harry suggested.
   “Nah can't spell it. All right—Voldemort.” Hagrid shuddered. “Don't make me say it again. Anyway, this—this wizard, twenty years ago now, started lookin' fer followers. Got 'em, too—some were afraid, some just wanted bit o' his power, 'cause he was gettin' himself power, all right. Dark days, Harry. Didn't know who ter trust, didn't dare get friendly strange wizards or witches… terrible things happened. He was takin' over. 'Course, some stood up him—an' he killed 'em. Horribly. One o' only safe places left was Hogwarts. Reckon Dumbledore's only one You-Know-Who was afraid of. Didn't dare try takin' school, not jus' then, anyway.
   “Now, yer mum an' dad were good witch an' wizard I ever knew. Head boy an' girl Hogwarts their day! Suppose myst'ry is why You-Know-Who never tried get 'em his side before… probably knew they were too close ter Dumbledore ter want anythin' ter do Dark Side.
   “Maybe he thought he could persuade 'em… maybe he just wanted 'em outta way. All anyone knows is, he turned up village where you was all living, Halloween ten years ago. You was just year old. He came ter yer house an'—an'—”
   Hagrid suddenly pulled out very dirty, spotted handkerchief and blew his nose sound like foghorn.
   “Sorry,” he said. “But it's that sad—knew yer mum an' dad, an' nicer people yeh couldn't find—anyway…”
   “You-Know-Who killed 'em. An' then—an' this is real myst'ry thing—he tried kill you, too. Wanted ter make clean job it, I suppose, or maybe he just liked killin' by then. But he couldn't do it. Never wondered how you got that mark yer forehead? That was no ordinary cut. That's what yeh get when powerful, evil curse touches yeh—took care yer mum an' dad an' yer house, even—but it didn't work you, an' that's why yer famous, Harry. No one ever lived after he decided ter kill ‘em, no one except you, an' he'd killed some o' best witches an' wizards age—the McKinnons, Bones, Prewetts—an' you was only baby, an' you lived.”
   Something very painful was going Harry's mind. Hagrid's story came close, he saw again blinding flash green light, more clearly than he had ever remembered it before—and he remembered something else, first time his life: high, cold, cruel laugh.
   Hagrid was watching him sadly.
   “Took yeh ruined house myself, Dumbledore's orders. Brought yeh ter this lot…”
   “Load old tosh,” said Uncle Vernon. Harry jumped; he had almost forgotten that Dursleys were there. Uncle Vernon certainly seemed have got back his courage. He was glaring Hagrid and his fists were clenched.
   “Now, you listen here, boy,” he snarled, “I accept there's something strange you, probably nothing good beating wouldn't have cured—and all this your parents, well, they were weirdos, no denying it, and world's better off without them my opinion—asked all they got, getting mixed up these wizarding types—just what I expected, always knew they'd come sticky end—”
   But that moment, Hagrid leapt sofa and drew battered pink umbrella inside his coat. Pointing this Uncle Vernon like sword, he said, “I'm warning you, Dursley—I'm warning you—one more word…”
   danger being speared end an umbrella by bearded giant, Uncle Vernon's courage failed again; he flattened himself against wall and fell silent.
   “That's better,” said Hagrid, breathing heavily and sitting back down sofa, which this time sagged right down floor.
   Harry, meanwhile, still had questions ask, hundreds them.
   “But what happened Vol—, sorry—I mean, You-Know-Who?”
   “Good question, Harry. Disappeared. Vanished. Same night he tried ter kill you. Makes yeh even more famous. That's biggest myst'ry, see… he was gettin' more an' more powerful—why'd he go?
   “Some say he died. Codswallop, my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left him die. Some say he's still out there, bidin' his time, like, but I don' believe it. People who was his side came back ter ours. Some 'em came outta kinda trances. Don' reckon they could've done if he was comin' back.
   “Most us reckon he's still out there somewhere but lost his powers. Too weak carry on. 'Cause somethin' you finished him, Harry. There was somethin' goin' that night he hadn't counted on—I dunno what it was, no one does—but somethin' you stumped him, all right.”
   Hagrid looked Harry warmth and respect blazing his eyes, but Harry, instead feeling pleased and proud, felt quite sure there had been horrible mistake. wizard? Him? How could he possibly be? He'd spent his life being clouted by Dudley, and bullied by Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon; if he was really wizard, why hadn't they been turned warty toads every time they'd tried lock him his cupboard? If he'd once defeated greatest sorcerer world, how come Dudley had always been able kick him around like football?
   “Hagrid,” he said quietly, “I think you must have made mistake. I don't think I can be wizard.”
   his surprise, Hagrid chuckled.
   “Not wizard, eh? Never made things happen when you was scared or angry?”
   Harry looked fire. Now he came think it… every odd thing that had ever made his aunt and uncle furious him had happened when he, Harry, had been upset or angry… chased by Dudley's gang, he had somehow found himself out their reach… dreading going school that ridiculous haircut, he'd managed make it grow back… and very last time Dudley had hit him, hadn't he got his revenge, without even realizing he was doing it? Hadn't he set boa constrictor him?
   Harry looked back Hagrid, smiling, and saw that Hagrid was positively beaming him.
   “See?” said Hagrid. “Harry Potter, not wizard—you wait, you'll be right famous Hogwarts.”
   But Uncle Vernon wasn't going give without fight.
   “Haven't I told you he's not going?” he hissed. “He's going Stonewall High and he'll be grateful it. I've read those letters and he needs all sorts rubbish—spell books and wands and—”
   “If he wants ter go, great Muggle like you won't stop him,” growled Hagrid. “Stop Lily an' James Potter's son goin' ter Hogwarts! Yer mad. His name's been down ever since he was born. He's off ter finest school witchcraft and wizardry world. Seven years there and he won't know himself. He'll be youngsters his own sort, fer change, an' he'll be under greatest headmaster Hogwarts ever had Albus Dumbled—”
   “I AM NOT PAYING SOME CRACKPOT OLD FOOL TEACH HIM MAGIC TRICKS!” yelled Uncle Vernon.
   But he had finally gone too far. Hagrid seized his umbrella and whirled it over his head, “NEVER,” he thundered, “—INSULT—ALBUS—DUMBLEDORE—IN—FRONT—OF—ME!”
   He brought umbrella swishing down through air point Dudley—there was flash violet light, sound like firecracker, sharp squeal, and next second, Dudley was dancing spot his hands clasped over his fat bottom, howling pain. When he turned his back them, Harry saw curly pig's tail poking through hole his trousers.
   Uncle Vernon roared. Pulling Aunt Petunia and Dudley other room, he cast one last terrified look Hagrid and slammed door behind them.
   Hagrid looked down his umbrella and stroked his beard.
   “Shouldn'ta lost me temper,” he said ruefully, “but it didn't work anyway. Meant ter turn him pig, but I suppose he was so much like pig anyway there wasn't much left ter do.”
   He cast sideways look Harry under his bushy eyebrows.
   “Be grateful if yeh didn't mention that ter anyone Hogwarts,” he said. “I'm—er—not supposed ter do magic, strictly speakin'. I was allowed ter do bit ter follow yeh an' get yer letters yeh an' stuff—one o' reasons I was so keen ter take job—”
   “Why aren't you supposed do magic?” asked Harry.
   “Oh, well—I was Hogwarts meself but I—er—got expelled, ter tell yeh truth. me third year. They snapped me wand half an' everything. But Dumbledore let me stay gamekeeper. Great man, Dumbledore.”
   “Why were you expelled?”
   “It's gettin' late and we've got lots ter do tomorrow,” said Hagrid loudly. “Gotta get up ter town, get all yer books an' that.”
   He took off his thick black coat and threw it Harry.
   “You can kip under that,” he said. “Don' mind if it wriggles bit, I think I still got couple o' dormice one o' pockets.”
  

  

   

    5. DIAGON ALLEY
   

   Harry woke early next morning. Although he could tell it was daylight, he kept his eyes shut tight.
   “It was dream, he told himself firmly. “I dreamed giant called Hagrid came tell me I was going school wizards. When I open my eyes I'll be home my cupboard.”
   There was suddenly loud tapping noise.
   And there's Aunt Petunia knocking door, Harry thought, his heart sinking. But he still didn't open his eyes. It had been such good dream.
   Tap. Tap. Tap.
   “All right,” Harry mumbled, “I'm getting up.”
   He sat up and Hagrid's heavy coat fell off him. hut was full sunlight, storm was over, Hagrid himself was asleep collapsed sofa, and there was an owl rapping its claw window, newspaper held its beak.
   Harry scrambled his feet, so happy he felt though large balloon was swelling inside him. He went straight window and jerked it open. owl swooped and dropped newspaper top Hagrid, who didn't wake up. owl then fluttered onto floor and began attack Hagrid's coat.
   “Don't do that.”
   Harry tried wave owl out way, but it snapped its beak fiercely him and carried savaging coat.
   “Hagrid!” said Harry loudly. “There's an owl—”
   “Pay him,” Hagrid grunted sofa.
   “What?”
   “He wants payin' fer deliverin' paper. Look pockets.”
   Hagrid's coat seemed be made nothing but pockets—bunches keys, slug pellets, balls string, peppermint humbugs, teabags… finally, Harry pulled out handful strange looking coins.
   “Give him five Knuts,” said Hagrid sleepily.
   “Knuts?”
   “The little bronze ones.”
   Harry counted out five little bronze coins, and owl held out his leg so Harry could put money small leather pouch tied it. Then he flew off through open window.
   Hagrid yawned loudly, sat up, and stretched.
   “Best be off, Harry, lots ter do today, gotta get up ter London an' buy all yer stuff fer school.”
   Harry was turning over wizard coins and looking them. He had just thought something that made him feel though happy balloon inside him had got puncture.
   “Um—Hagrid?”
   “Mm?” said Hagrid, who was pulling his huge boots.
   “I haven't got any money—and you heard Uncle Vernon last night… he won't pay me go and learn magic.”
   “Don't worry that,” said Hagrid, standing up and scratching his head. “D'yeh think yer parents didn't leave yeh anything?”
   “But if their house was destroyed—”
   “They didn' keep their gold house, boy! Nah, first stop fer us is Gringotts. Wizards' bank. Have sausage, they're not bad cold—an' I wouldn' say no teh bit o' yer birthday cake, neither.”
   “Wizards have banks?”
   “Just one. Gringotts. Run by goblins.”
   Harry dropped bit sausage he was holding.
   “Goblins?”
   “Yeah—so yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it, I'll tell yeh that. Never mess goblins, Harry. Gringotts is safest place world fer anything yeh want ter keep safe—'cept maybe Hogwarts. matter o' fact, I gotta visit Gringotts anyway. Fer Dumbledore. Hogwarts business.” Hagrid drew himself up proudly. “He usually gets me ter do important stuff fer him. Fetchin' you gettin' things Gringotts—knows he can trust me, see.
   “Got everythin'? Come on, then.”
   Harry followed Hagrid out onto rock. sky was quite clear now and sea gleamed sunlight. boat Uncle Vernon had hired was still there, lot water bottom after storm.
   “How did you get here?” Harry asked, looking around another boat.
   “Flew,” said Hagrid.
   “Flew?”
   “Yeah—but we'll go back this. Not s'pposed ter use magic now I've got yeh.”
   They settled down boat, Harry still staring Hagrid, trying imagine him flying.
   “Seems shame ter row, though,” said Hagrid, giving Harry another his sideways looks. “If I was ter—er—speed things up bit, would yeh mind not mentionin' it Hogwarts?”
   “Of course not,” said Harry, eager see more magic. Hagrid pulled out pink umbrella again, tapped it twice side boat, and they sped off toward land.
   “Why would you be mad try and rob Gringotts?” Harry asked.
   “Spells—enchantments,” said Hagrid, unfolding his newspaper he spoke. “They say there's dragons guardin' highsecurity vaults. And then yeh gotta find yer way—Gringotts is hundreds miles under London, see. Deep under Underground. Yeh'd die hunger tryin' ter get out, even if yeh did manage ter get yer hands summat.”
   Harry sat and thought this while Hagrid read his newspaper, Daily Prophet. Harry had learned Uncle Vernon that people liked be left alone while they did this, but it was very difficult, he'd never had so many questions his life.
   “Ministry o' Magic messin' things up usual,” Hagrid muttered, turning page.
   “There's Ministry Magic?” Harry asked, before he could stop himself.
   “'Course,” said Hagrid. “They wanted Dumbledore fer Minister, o' course, but he'd never leave Hogwarts, so old Cornelius Fudge got job. Bungler if ever there was one. So he pelts Dumbledore owls every morning, askin' fer advice.”
   “But what does Ministry Magic do?”
   “Well, their main job is keep it Muggles that there's still witches an' wizards up an' down country.”
   “Why?”
   “Why? Blimey, Harry, everyone'd be wantin' magic solutions their problems. Nah, we're best left alone.”
   this moment boat bumped gently harbor wall. Hagrid folded up his newspaper, and they clambered up stone steps onto street.
   Passersby stared lot Hagrid they walked through little town station. Harry couldn't blame them. Not only was Hagrid twice tall anyone else, he kept pointing perfectly ordinary things like parking meters and saying loudly, “See that, Harry? Things these Muggles dream up, eh?”
   “Hagrid,” said Harry, panting bit he ran keep up, “did you say there are dragons Gringotts?”
   “Well, so they say,” said Hagrid. “Crikey, I'd like dragon.”
   “You'd like one?”
   “Wanted one ever since I was kid—here we go.”
   They had reached station. There was train London five minutes' time. Hagrid, who didn't understand “Muggle money,” he called it, gave bills Harry so he could buy their tickets.
   People stared more than ever train. Hagrid took up two seats and sat knitting what looked like canary yellow circus tent.
   “Still got yer letter, Harry?” he asked he counted stitches. Harry took parchment envelope out his pocket.
   “Good,” said Hagrid. “There's list there everything yeh need.”
   Harry unfolded second piece paper he hadn't noticed night before, and read:

   “Can we buy all this London?” Harry wondered aloud.
   “If yeh know where go,” said Hagrid.
   Harry had never been London before. Although Hagrid seemed know where he was going, he was obviously not used getting there an ordinary way. He got stuck ticket barrier Underground, and complained loudly that seats were too small and trains too slow.
   “I don't know how Muggles manage without magic,” he said they climbed broken down escalator that led up bustling road lined shops.
   Hagrid was so huge that he parted crowd easily; all Harry had do was keep close behind him. They passed book shops and music stores, hamburger restaurants and cinemas, but nowhere that looked if it could sell you magic wand. This was just an ordinary street full ordinary people. Could there really be piles wizard gold buried miles beneath them? Were there really shops that sold spell books and broomsticks? Might this not all be some huge joke that Dursleys had cooked up? If Harry hadn't known that Dursleys had no sense humor, he might have thought so; yet somehow, even though everything Hagrid had told him so far was unbelievable, Harry couldn't help trusting him.
   “This is it,” said Hagrid, coming halt, “the Leaky Cauldron. It's famous place.”
   It was tiny, grubby looking pub. If Hagrid hadn't pointed it out, Harry wouldn't have noticed it was there. people hurrying by didn't glance it. Their eyes slid big book shop one side record shop other if they couldn't see Leaky Cauldron all. fact, Harry had most peculiar feeling that only he and Hagrid could see it. Before he could mention this, Hagrid had steered him inside.
   famous place, it was very dark and shabby. few old women were sitting corner, drinking tiny glasses sherry. One them was smoking long pipe. little man top hat was talking old bartender, who was quite bald and looked like toothless walnut. low buzz chatter stopped when they walked in. Everyone seemed know Hagrid; they waved and smiled him, and bartender reached glass, saying, “The usual, Hagrid?”
   “Can't, Tom, I'm Hogwarts business,” said Hagrid, clapping his great hand Harry's shoulder and making Harry's knees buckle.
   “Good Lord,” said bartender, peering Harry, “is this—can this be ?”
   Leaky Cauldron had suddenly gone completely still and silent.
   “Bless my soul,” whispered old bartender, “Harry Potter… what an honor.”
   He hurried out behind bar, rushed toward Harry and seized his hand, tears his eyes.
   “Welcome back, Mr. Potter, welcome back.”
   Harry didn't know what say. Everyone was looking him. old woman pipe was puffing it without realizing it had gone out. Hagrid was beaming.
   Then there was great scraping chairs and next moment, Harry found himself shaking hands everyone Leaky Cauldron.
   “Doris Crockford, Mr. Potter, can't believe I'm meeting you last.”
   “So proud, Mr. Potter, I'm just so proud.”
   “Always wanted shake your hand—I'm all flutter.”
   “Delighted, Mr. Potter, just can't tell you, Diggle's name, Dedalus Diggle.”
   “I've seen you before!” said Harry, Dedalus Diggle's top hat fell off his excitement. “You bowed me once shop.”
   “He remembers!” cried Dedalus Diggle, looking around everyone. “Did you hear that? He remembers me!” Harry shook hands again and again—Doris Crockford kept coming back more.
   pale young man made his way forward, very nervously. One his eyes was twitching.
   “Professor Quirrell!” said Hagrid. “Harry, Professor Quirrell will be one your teachers Hogwarts.”
   “P-P-Potter,” stammered Professor Quirrell, grasping Harry's hand, “c-can't t-tell you how p-pleased I am meet you.”
   “What sort magic do you teach, Professor Quirrell?”
   “D-Defense Against D-D-Dark Arts,” muttered Professor Quirrell, though he'd rather not think it. “N-not that you n-need it, eh, P-P-Potter?” He laughed nervously. “You'll be g-getting all your equipment, I suppose? I've g-got p-pick up new b-book vampires, m-myself.” He looked terrified very thought.
   But others wouldn't let Professor Quirrell keep Harry himself. It took almost ten minutes get away them all. last, Hagrid managed make himself heard over babble.
   “Must get on—lots ter buy. Come on, Harry.”
   Doris Crockford shook Harry's hand one last time, and Hagrid led them through bar and out small, walled courtyard, where there was nothing but trash can and few weeds.
   Hagrid grinned Harry.
   “Told yeh, didn't I? Told yeh you was famous. Even Professor Quirrell was tremblin' ter meet yeh—mind you, he's usually tremblin'.”
   “Is he always that nervous?”
   “Oh, yeah. Poor bloke. Brilliant mind. He was fine while he was studyin' outta books but then he took year off ter get some firsthand experience… They say he met vampires Black Forest, and there was nasty bit o' trouble hag—never been same since. Scared students, scared his own subject now, where's me umbrella?”
   Vampires? Hags? Harry's head was swimming. Hagrid, meanwhile, was counting bricks wall above trash can.
   “Three up… two across,” he muttered. “Right, stand back, Harry.”
   He tapped wall three times point his umbrella.
   brick he had touched quivered—it wriggled—in middle, small hole appeared—it grew wider and wider—a second later they were facing an archway large enough even Hagrid, an archway onto cobbled street that twisted and turned out sight.
   “Welcome,” said Hagrid, “to Diagon Alley.”
   He grinned Harry's amazement. They stepped through archway. Harry looked quickly over his shoulder and saw archway shrink instantly back solid wall.
   sun shone brightly stack cauldrons outside nearest shop. Cauldrons—All Sizes—Copper, Brass, Pewter, Silver—Self Stirring—Collapsible, said sign hanging over them.
   “Yeah, you'll be needin' one,” said Hagrid, “but we gotta get yer money first.”
   Harry wished he had eight more eyes. He turned his head every direction they walked up street, trying look everything once: shops, things outside them, people doing their shopping. plump woman outside an Apothecary was shaking her head they passed, saying, “Dragon liver, seventeen Sickles an ounce, they're mad…”
   low, soft hooting came dark shop sign saying Eeylops Owl Emporium—Tawny, Screech, Barn, Brown, and Snowy. Several boys Harry's age had their noses pressed against window broomsticks it. “Look,” Harry heard one them say, “the new Nimbus Two Thousand—fastest ever—” There were shops selling robes, shops selling telescopes and strange silver instruments Harry had never seen before, windows stacked barrels bat spleens and eels' eyes, tottering piles spell books, quills, and rolls parchment, potion bottles, globes moon…
   “Gringotts,” said Hagrid.
   They had reached snowy white building that towered over other little shops. Standing beside its burnished bronze doors, wearing uniform scarlet and gold, was—
   “Yeah, that's goblin,” said Hagrid quietly they walked up white stone steps toward him. goblin was head shorter than Harry. He had swarthy, clever face, pointed beard and, Harry noticed, very long fingers and feet. He bowed they walked inside. Now they were facing second pair doors, silver this time, words engraved upon them:
   
    
     Enter, stranger, but take heed

     what awaits sin greed,

     those who take, but do not earn,

     Must pay most dearly their turn.

    

    
     So if you seek beneath our floors

     treasure that was never yours,

     Thief, you have been warned, beware

     finding more than treasure there.

    

   
   “Like I said, Yeh'd be mad ter try an' rob it,” said Hagrid.
   pair goblins bowed them through silver doors and they were vast marble hall. hundred more goblins were sitting high stools behind long counter, scribbling large ledgers, weighing coins brass scales, examining precious stones through eyeglasses. There were too many doors count leading off hall, and yet more goblins were showing people and out these. Hagrid and Harry made counter.
   “Morning,” said Hagrid free goblin. “We've come ter take some money outta Mr. Harry Potter's safe.”
   “You have his key, sir?”
   “Got it here somewhere,” said Hagrid, and he started emptying his pockets onto counter, scattering handful moldy dog biscuits over goblin's book numbers. goblin wrinkled his nose. Harry watched goblin their right weighing pile rubies big glowing coals.
   “Got it,” said Hagrid last, holding up tiny golden key.
   goblin looked it closely.
   “That seems be order.”
   “An' I've also got letter here Professor Dumbledore,” said Hagrid importantly, throwing out his chest. “It's You-Know-What vault seven hundred and thirteen.”
   goblin read letter carefully.
   “Very well,” he said, handing it back Hagrid, “I will have someone take you down both vaults. Griphook!”
   Griphook was yet another goblin. Once Hagrid had crammed all dog biscuits back inside his pockets, he and Harry followed Griphook toward one doors leading off hall.
   “What's You-Know-What vault seven hundred and thirteen?” Harry asked.
   “Can't tell yeh that,” said Hagrid mysteriously. “Very secret. Hogwarts business. Dumbledore's trusted me. More 'n my job's worth ter tell yeh that.”
   Griphook held door open them. Harry, who had expected more marble, was surprised. They were narrow stone passageway lit flaming torches. It sloped steeply downward and there were little railway tracks floor. Griphook whistled and small cart came hurtling up tracks toward them. They climbed in—Hagrid some difficulty—and were off.
   first they just hurtled through maze twisting passages. Harry tried remember, left, right, right, left, middle fork, right, left, but it was impossible. rattling cart seemed know its own way, because Griphook wasn't steering.
   Harry's eyes stung cold air rushed past them, but he kept them wide open. Once, he thought he saw burst fire end passage and twisted around see if it was dragon, but too late—they plunged even deeper, passing an underground lake where huge stalactites and stalagmites grew ceiling and floor.
   “I never know,” Harry called Hagrid over noise cart, “what's difference between stalagmite and stalactite?”
   “Stalagmite's got an ‘m' it,” said Hagrid. “An' don' ask me questions just now, I think I'm gonna be sick.”
   He did look very green, and when cart stopped last beside small door passage wall, Hagrid got out and had lean against wall stop his knees trembling.
   Griphook unlocked door. lot green smoke came billowing out, and it cleared, Harry gasped. Inside were mounds gold coins. Columns silver. Heaps little bronze Knuts.
   “All yours,” smiled Hagrid.
   All Harry's—it was incredible. Dursleys couldn't have known this or they'd have had it him faster than blinking. How often had they complained how much Harry cost them keep? And all time there had been small fortune belonging him, buried deep under London.
   Hagrid helped Harry pile some it bag.
   “The gold ones are Galleons,” he explained. “Seventeen silver Sickles Galleon and twenty nine Knuts Sickle, it's easy enough. Right, that should be enough fer couple o' terms, we'll keep rest safe yeh.” He turned Griphook. “Vault seven hundred and thirteen now, please, and can we go more slowly?”
   “One speed only,” said Griphook.
   They were going even deeper now and gathering speed. air became colder and colder they hurtled round tight corners. They went rattling over an underground ravine, and Harry leaned over side try see what was down dark bottom, but Hagrid groaned and pulled him back by scruff his neck.
   Vault seven hundred and thirteen had no keyhole.
   “Stand back,” said Griphook importantly. He stroked door gently one his long fingers and it simply melted away.
   “If anyone but Gringotts goblin tried that, they'd be sucked through door and trapped there,” said Griphook.
   “How often do you check see if anyone's inside?” Harry asked.
   “About once every ten years,” said Griphook rather nasty grin.
   Something really extraordinary had be inside this top security vault, Harry was sure, and he leaned forward eagerly, expecting see fabulous jewels very least—but first he thought it was empty. Then he noticed grubby little package wrapped up brown paper lying floor. Hagrid picked it up and tucked it deep inside his coat. Harry longed know what it was, but knew better than ask.
   “Come on, back this infernal cart, and don't talk me way back, it's best if I keep me mouth shut,” said Hagrid.
   One wild cart ride later they stood blinking sunlight outside Gringotts. Harry didn't know where run first now that he had bag full money. He didn't have know how many Galleons there were pound know that he was holding more money than he'd had his whole life—more money than even Dudley had ever had.
   “Might well get yer uniform,” said Hagrid, nodding toward Madam Malkin's Robes All Occasions. “Listen, Harry, would yeh mind if I slipped off fer pick me up Leaky Cauldron? I hate them Gringotts carts.” He did still look bit sick, so Harry entered Madam Malkin's shop alone, feeling nervous.
   Madam Malkin was squat, smiling witch dressed all mauve.
   “Hogwarts, dear?” she said, when Harry started speak. “Got lot here—another young man being fitted up just now, fact.”
   back shop, boy pale, pointed face was standing footstool while second witch pinned up his long black robes. Madam Malkin stood Harry stool next him) slipped long robe over his head, and began pin it right length.
   “Hello,” said boy, “Hogwarts, too?”
   “Yes,” said Harry.
   “My father's next door buying my books and mother's up street looking wands,” said boy. He had bored, drawling voice. “Then I'm going drag them off took racing brooms. I don't see why first years can't have their own. I think I'll bully father getting me one and I'll smuggle it somehow.”
   Harry was strongly reminded Dudley.
   “Have you got your own broom?” boy went on.
   “No,” said Harry.
   “Play Quidditch all?”
   “No,” Harry said again, wondering what earth Quidditch could be.
   “I do—Father says it's crime if I'm not picked play my house, and I must say, I agree. Know what house you'll be yet?”
   “No,” said Harry, feeling more stupid by minute.
   “Well, no one really knows until they get there, do they, but I know I'll be Slytherin, all our family have been—imagine being Hufflepuff, I think I'd leave, wouldn't you?”
   “Mmm,” said Harry, wishing he could say something bit more interesting.
   “I say, look that man!” said boy suddenly, nodding toward front window. Hagrid was standing there, grinning Harry and pointing two large ice creams show he couldn't come in.
   “That's Hagrid,” said Harry, pleased know something boy didn't. “He works Hogwarts.”
   “Oh,” said boy, “I've heard him. He's sort servant, isn't he?”
   “He's gamekeeper,” said Harry. He was liking boy less and less every second.
   “Yes, exactly. I heard he's sort savage—lives hut school grounds and every now and then he gets drunk, tries do magic, and ends up setting fire his bed.”
   “I think he's brilliant,” said Harry coldly.
   “Do you?” said boy, slight sneer. “Why is he you? Where are your parents?”
   “They're dead,” said Harry shortly. He didn't feel much like going matter this boy.
   “Oh, sorry,” said other, not sounding sorry all. “But they were our kind, weren't they?”
   “They were witch and wizard, if that's what you mean.”
   “I really don't think they should let other sort in, do you? They're just not same, they've never been brought up know our ways. Some them have never even heard Hogwarts until they get letter, imagine. I think they should keep it old wizarding families. What's your surname, anyway?”
   But before Harry could answer, Madam Malkin said, “That's you done, my dear,” and Harry, not sorry an excuse stop talking boy, hopped down footstool.
   “Well, I'll see you Hogwarts, I suppose,” said drawling boy.
   Harry was rather quiet he ate ice cream Hagrid had bought him (chocolate and raspberry chopped nuts).
   “What's up?” said Hagrid.
   “Nothing,” Harry lied. They stopped buy parchment and quills. Harry cheered up bit when he found bottle ink that changed color you wrote. When they had left shop, he said, “Hagrid, what's Quidditch?”
   “Blimey, Harry, I keep forgettin' how little yeh know—not knowin' Quidditch!”
   “Don't make me feel worse,” said Harry. He told Hagrid pate boy Madam Malkin's.
   “—and he said people Muggle families shouldn't even be allowed in.”
   “Yer not Muggle family. If he'd known who yeh were—he's grown up knowin' yer name if his parents are wizardin' folk. You saw what everyone Leaky Cauldron was like when they saw yeh. Anyway, what does he know it, some o' best I ever saw were only ones magic 'em long line o' Muggles—look yer mum! Look what she had fer sister!”
   “So what is Quidditch?”
   “It's our sport. Wizard sport. It's like—like soccer Muggle world—everyone follows Quidditch—played up air broomsticks and there's four balls—sorta hard ter explain rules.”
   “And what are Slytherin and Hufflepuff?”
   “School houses. There's four. Everyone says Hufflepuff are lot o' duffers, but—”
   “I bet I'm Hufflepuff,” said Harry gloomily.
   “Better Hufflepuff than Slytherin,” said Hagrid darkly. “There's not single witch or wizard who went bad who wasn't Slytherin. You-Know-Who was one.”
   “Vol—sorry—You-Know-Who was Hogwarts?”
   “Years an' years ago,” said Hagrid.
   They bought Harry's school books shop called Flourish and Blotts where shelves were stacked ceiling books large paving stones bound leather; books size postage stamps covers silk; books full peculiar symbols and few books nothing them all. Even Dudley, who never read anything, would have been wild get his hands some these. Hagrid almost had drag Harry away Curses and Countercurses (Bewitch Your Friends and Befuddle Your Enemies Latest Revenges: Hair Loss, Jelly Legs, Tongue-Tying and Much, Much More) by Professor Vindictus Viridian.
   “I was trying find out how curse Dudley.”
   “I'm not sayin' that's not good idea, but yer not ter use magic Muggle world except very special circumstances,” said Hagrid. “An' anyway, yeh couldn' work any curses yet, yeh'll need lot more study before yeh get ter that level.”
   Hagrid wouldn't let Harry buy solid gold cauldron, either (“It says pewter yer list”), but they got nice set scales weighing potion ingredients and collapsible brass telescope. Then they visited Apothecary, which was fascinating enough make up its horrible smell, mixture bad eggs and rotted cabbages. Barrels slimy stuff stood floor; jars herbs, dried roots, and bright powders lined walls; bundles feathers, strings fangs, and snarled claws hung ceiling. While Hagrid asked man behind counter supply some basic potion ingredients Harry, Harry himself examined silver unicorn horns twenty one Galleons each and minuscule, glittery black beetle eyes (five Knuts scoop).
   Outside Apothecary, Hagrid checked Harry's list again.
   “Just yer wand left—A yeah, an' I still haven't got yeh birthday present.”
   Harry felt himself go red.
   “You don't have to—”
   “I know I don't have to. Tell yeh what, I'll get yer animal. Not toad, toads went outta fashion years ago, yeh'd be laughed at—an' I don' like cats, they make me sneeze. I'll get yer an owl. All kids want owls, they're dead useful, carry yer mail an' everythin'.”
   Twenty minutes later, they left Eeylops Owl Emporium, which had been dark and full rustling and flickering, jewel bright eyes. Harry now carried large cage that held beautiful snowy owl, fast asleep her head under her wing. He couldn't stop stammering his thanks, sounding just like Professor Quirrell.
   “Don' mention it,” said Hagrid gruffly. “Don' expect you've had lotta presents them Dursleys. Just Ollivander's left now—only place fer wands, Ollivander's, and yeh gotta have best wand.”
   magic wand… this was what Harry had been really looking forward to.
   last shop was narrow and shabby. Peeling gold letters over door read Ollivanders: Makers Fine Wands since 382 B.C. single wand lay faded purple cushion dusty window.
   tinkling bell rang somewhere depths shop they stepped inside. It was tiny place, empty except single, spindly chair that Hagrid sat wait. Harry felt strangely though he had entered very strict library; he swallowed lot new questions that had just occurred him and looked instead thousands narrow boxes piled neatly right up ceiling. some reason, back his neck prickled. very dust and silence here seemed tingle some secret magic.
   “Good afternoon,” said soft voice. Harry jumped. Hagrid must have jumped, too, because there was loud crunching noise and he got quickly off spindly chair.
   An old man was standing before them, his wide, pale eyes shining like moons through gloom shop.
   “Hello,” said Harry awkwardly.
   “Ah yes,” said man. “Yes, yes. I thought I'd be seeing you soon. Harry Potter.” It wasn't question. “You have your mother's eyes. It seems only yesterday she was here herself, buying her first wand. Ten and quarter inches long, swishy, made willow. Nice wand charm work.”
   Mr. Ollivander moved closer Harry. Harry wished he would blink. Those silvery eyes were bit creepy.
   “Your father, other hand, favored mahogany wand. Eleven inches. Pliable. little more power and excellent transfiguration. Well, I say your father favored it—it's really wand that chooses wizard, course.”
   Mr. Ollivander had come so close that he and Harry were almost nose nose. Harry could see himself reflected those misty eyes.
   “And that's where…”
   Mr. Ollivander touched lightning scar Harry's forehead long, white finger.
   “I'm sorry say I sold wand that did it,” he said softly. “Thirteen and half inches. Yew. Powerful wand, very powerful, and wrong hands… well, if I'd known what that wand was going out world do…”
   He shook his head and then, Harry's relief, spotted Hagrid.
   “Rubeus! Rubeus Hagrid! How nice see you again… Oak, sixteen inches, rather bendy, wasn't it?”
   “It was, sir, yes,” said Hagrid.
   “Good wand, that one. But I suppose they snapped it half when you got expelled?” said Mr. Ollivander, suddenly stern.
   “Er—yes, they did, yes,” said Hagrid, shuffling his feet. “I've still got pieces, though,” he added brightly.
   “But you don't use them?” said Mr. Ollivander sharply.
   “Oh, no, sir,” said Hagrid quickly. Harry noticed he gripped his pink umbrella very tightly he spoke.
   “Hmmm,” said Mr. Ollivander, giving Hagrid piercing look. “Well, now—Mr. Potter. Let me see.” He pulled long tape measure silver markings out his pocket. “Which is your wand arm?”
   “Er—well, I'm right handed,” said Harry.
   “Hold out your arm. That's it.” He measured Harry shoulder finger, then wrist elbow, shoulder floor, knee armpit and round his head. he measured, he said, “Every Ollivander wand has core powerful magical substance, Mr. Potter. We use unicorn hairs, phoenix tail feathers, and heartstrings dragons. No two Ollivander wands are same, just no two unicorns, dragons, or phoenixes are quite same. And course, you will never get such good results another wizard's wand.”
   Harry suddenly realized that tape measure, which was measuring between his nostrils, was doing this its own. Mr. Ollivander was flitting around shelves, taking down boxes.
   “That will do,” he said, and tape measure crumpled heap floor. “Right then, Mr. Potter. Try this one. Beechwood and dragon heartstring. Nine inches. Nice and flexible. just take it and give it wave.”
   Harry took wand and (feeling foolish) waved it around bit, but Mr. Ollivander snatched it out his hand almost once.
   “Maple and phoenix feather. Seven inches. Quite whippy. Try—”
   Harry tried—but he had hardly raised wand when it, too, was snatched back by Mr. Ollivander.
   “No, no here, ebony and unicorn hair, eight and half inches, springy. Go on, go on, try it out.”
   Harry tried. And tried. He had no idea what Mr. Ollivander was waiting for. pile tried wands was mounting higher and higher spindly chair, but more wands Mr. Ollivander pulled shelves, happier he seemed become.
   “Tricky customer, eh? Not worry, we'll find perfect match here somewhere—I wonder, now—yes, why not—unusual combination—holly and phoenix feather, eleven inches, nice and supple.”
   Harry took wand. He felt sudden warmth his fingers. He raised wand above his head, brought it swishing down through dusty air and stream red and gold sparks shot end like firework, throwing dancing spots light walls. Hagrid whooped and clapped and Mr. Ollivander cried, “Oh, bravo! Yes, indeed, oh, very good. Well, well, well… how curious… how very curious…”
   He put Harry's wand back its box and wrapped it brown paper, still muttering, “Curious… curious…”
   “Sorry,” said Harry, “butwhat's curious?”
   Mr. Ollivander fixed Harry his pale stare.
   “I remember every wand I've ever sold, Mr. Potter. Every single wand. It so happens that phoenix whose tail feather is your wand, gave another feather—just one other. It is very curious indeed that you should be destined this wand when it's brother—why, it's brother gave you that scar.”
   Harry swallowed.
   “Yes, thirteen and half inches. Yew. Curious indeed how these things happen. wand chooses wizard, remember… I think we must expect great things you, Mr. Potter… After all, He-Who-Must-Not-Be-Named did great things—terrible, yes, but great.”
   Harry shivered. He wasn't sure he liked Mr. Ollivander too much. He paid seven gold Galleons his wand, and Mr. Ollivander bowed them his shop.
   late afternoon sun hung low sky Harry and Hagrid made their way back down Diagon Alley, back through wall, back through Leaky Cauldron, now empty. Harry didn't speak all they walked down road; he didn't even notice how much people were gawking them Underground, laden they were all their funny shaped packages, snowy owl asleep its cage Harry's lap. Up another escalator, out Paddington station; Harry only realized where they were when Hagrid tapped him shoulder.
   “Got time fer bite eat before yer train leaves,” he said.
   He bought Harry hamburger and they sat down plastic seats eat them. Harry kept looking around. Everything looked so strange, somehow.
   “You all right, Harry? Yer very quiet,” said Hagrid.
   Harry wasn't sure he could explain. He'd just had best birthday his life—and yet—he chewed his hamburger, trying find words.
   “Everyone thinks I'm special,” he said last. “All those people Leaky Cauldron, Professor Quirrell, Mr. Ollivander… but I don't know anything magic all. How can they expect great things? I'm famous and I can't even remember what I'm famous for. I don't know what happened when Vol—sorry—I mean, night my parents died.”
   Hagrid leaned across table. Behind wild beard and eyebrows he wore very kind smile.
   “Don' you worry, Harry. You'll learn fast enough. Everyone starts beginning Hogwarts, you'll be just fine. Just be yerself. I know it's hard. Yeh've been singled out, an' that's always hard. But yeh'll have great time Hogwarts—I did—still do, 'smatter fact.”
   Hagrid helped Harry train that would take him back Dursleys, then handed him an envelope.
   “Yer ticket fer Hogwarts,” he said. “First o' September—King's Cross—it's all yer ticket. Any problems Dursleys, send me letter yer owl, she'll know where find me… See yeh soon, Harry.”
   train pulled out station. Harry wanted watch Hagrid until he was out sight; he rose his seat and pressed his nose against window, but he blinked and Hagrid had gone.
  

  

   

    6. JOURNEY PLATFORM NINE AND THREE QUARTERS
   

   Harry's last month Dursleys wasn't fun. True, Dudley was now so scared Harry he wouldn't stay same room, while Aunt Petunia and Uncle Vernon didn't shut Harry his cupboard, force him do anything, or shout him—in fact, they didn't speak him all. Half terrified, half furious, they acted though any chair Harry it were empty. Although this was an improvement many ways, it did become bit depressing after while.
   Harry kept his room, his new owl company. He had decided call her Hedwig, name he had found History Magic. His school books were very interesting. He lay his bed reading late night, Hedwig swooping and out open window she pleased. It was lucky that Aunt Petunia didn't come vacuum anymore, because Hedwig kept bringing back dead mice. Every night before he went sleep, Harry ticked off another day piece paper he had pinned wall, counting down September first.
   last day August he thought he'd better speak his aunt and uncle getting King's Cross station next day, so he went down living room where they were watching quiz show television. He cleared his throat let them know he was there, and Dudley screamed and ran room.
   “Er—Uncle Vernon?”
   Uncle Vernon grunted show he was listening.
   “Er—I need be King's Cross tomorrow to—to go Hogwarts.”
   Uncle Vernon grunted again.
   “Would it be all right if you gave me lift?”
   Grunt. Harry supposed that meant yes.
   “Thank you.”
   He was go back upstairs when Uncle Vernon actually spoke.
   “Funny way get wizards' school, train. Magic carpets all got punctures, have they?”
   Harry didn't say anything.
   “Where is this school, anyway?”
   “I don't know,” said Harry, realizing this first time. He pulled ticket Hagrid had given him out his pocket.
   “I just take train platform nine and three-quarters eleven o'clock,” he read.
   His aunt and uncle stared.
   “Platform what?”
   “Nine and three-quarters.”
   “Don't talk rubbish,” said Uncle Vernon. “There is no platform nine and three-quarters.”
   “It's my ticket.”
   “Barking,” said Uncle Vernon, “howling mad, lot them. You'll see. You just wait. All right, we'll take you King's Cross. We're going up London tomorrow anyway, or I wouldn't bother.”
   “Why are you going London?” Harry asked, trying keep things friendly.
   “Taking Dudley hospital,” growled Uncle Vernon. “Got have that ruddy tail removed before he goes Smeltings.”
   Harry woke five o'clock next morning and was too excited and nervous go back sleep. He got up and pulled his jeans because he didn't want walk station his wizard's robes—he'd change train. He checked his Hogwarts list yet again make sure he had everything he needed, saw that Hedwig was shut safely her cage, and then paced room, waiting Dursleys get up. Two hours later, Harry's huge, heavy trunk had been loaded Dursleys' car, Aunt Petunia had talked Dudley sitting next Harry, and they had set off.
   They reached King's Cross half past ten. Uncle Vernon dumped Harry's trunk onto cart and wheeled it station him. Harry thought this was strangely kind until Uncle Vernon stopped dead, facing platforms nasty grin his face.
   “Well, there you are, boy. Platform nine—platform ten. Your platform should be somewhere middle, but they don't seem have built it yet, do they?”
   He was quite right, course. There was big plastic number nine over one platform and big plastic number ten over one next it, and middle, nothing all.
   “Have good term,” said Uncle Vernon an even nastier smile. He left without another word. Harry turned and saw Dursleys drive away. All three them were laughing. Harry's mouth went rather dry. What earth was he going do? He was starting attract lot funny looks, because Hedwig. He'd have ask someone.
   He stopped passing guard, but didn't dare mention platform nine and three-quarters. guard had never heard Hogwarts and when Harry couldn't even tell him what part country it was in, he started get annoyed, though Harry was being stupid purpose. Getting desperate, Harry asked train that left eleven o'clock, but guard said there wasn't one. end guard strode away, muttering time wasters. Harry was now trying hard not panic. According large clock over arrivals board, he had ten minutes left get train Hogwarts and he had no idea how do it; he was stranded middle station trunk he could hardly lift, pocket full wizard money, and large owl.
   Hagrid must have forgotten tell him something you had do, like tapping third brick left get Diagon Alley. He wondered if he should get out his wand and start tapping ticket inspector's stand between platforms nine and ten.
   that moment group people passed just behind him and he caught few words what they were saying.
   “—packed Muggles, course—”
   Harry swung round. speaker was plump woman who was talking four boys, all flaming red hair. Each them was pushing trunk like Harry's front him—and they had an owl.
   Heart hammering, Harry pushed his cart after them. They stopped and so did he, just near enough hear what they were saying.
   “Now, what's platform number?” said boys' mother.
   “Nine and three-quarters!” piped small girl, also red headed, who was holding her hand, “Mom, can't I go…”
   “You're not old enough, Ginny, now be quiet. All right, Percy, you go first.”
   What looked like oldest boy marched toward platforms nine and ten. Harry watched, careful not blink case he missed it—but just boy reached dividing barrier between two platforms, large crowd tourists came swarming front him and by time last backpack had cleared away, boy had vanished.
   “Fred, you next,” plump woman said.
   “I'm not Fred, I'm George,” said boy. “Honestly, woman, you call yourself our mother? Can't you tell I'm George?”
   “Sorry, George, dear.”
   “Only joking, I am Fred,” said boy, and off he went. His twin called after him hurry up, and he must have done so, because second later, he had gone—but how had he done it?
   Now third brother was walking briskly toward barrier he was almost there—and then, quite suddenly, he wasn't anywhere.
   There was nothing else it.
   “Excuse me,” Harry said plump woman.
   “Hello, dear,” she said. “First time Hogwarts? Ron's new, too.”
   She pointed last and youngest her sons. He was tall, thin, and gangling, freckles, big hands and feet, and long nose.
   “Yes,” said Harry. “The thing is—the thing is, I don't know how to—”
   “How get onto platform?” she said kindly, and Harry nodded.
   “Not worry,” she said. “All you have do is walk straight barrier between platforms nine and ten. Don't stop and don't be scared you'll crash it, that's very important. Best do it bit run if you're nervous. Go on, go now before Ron.”
   “Er—okay,” said Harry.
   He pushed his trolley around and stared barrier. It looked very solid.
   He started walk toward it. People jostled him their way platforms nine and ten. Harry walked more quickly. He was going smash right that barrier and then he'd be trouble—leaning forward his cart, he broke heavy run—the barrier was coming nearer and nearer—he wouldn't be able stop—the cart was out control—he was foot away—he closed his eyes ready crash—
   It didn't come… he kept running… he opened his eyes. scarlet steam engine was waiting next platform packed people. sign overhead said Hogwarts Express, eleven o'clock. Harry looked behind him and saw wrought iron archway where barrier had been, words Platform Nine and Three-quarters it, He had done it.
   Smoke engine drifted over heads chattering crowd, while cats every color wound here and there between their legs. Owls hooted one another disgruntled sort way over babble and scraping heavy trunks.
   first few carriages were already packed students, some hanging out window talk their families, some fighting over seats. Harry pushed his cart off down platform search an empty seat. He passed round faced boy who was saying, “Gran, I've lost my toad again.”
   “Oh, Neville,” he heard old woman sigh.
   boy dreadlocks was surrounded by small crowd.
   “Give us look, Lee, go on.”
   boy lifted lid box his arms, and people around him shrieked and yelled something inside poked out long, hairy leg.
   Harry pressed through crowd until he found an empty compartment near end train. He put Hedwig inside first and then started shove and heave his trunk toward train door. He tried lift it up steps but could hardly raise one end and twice he dropped it painfully his foot.
   “Want hand?” It was one red haired twins he'd followed through barrier.
   “Yes, please,” Harry panted.
   “Oy, Fred! C'mere and help!”
   twins' help, Harry's trunk was last tucked away corner compartment.
   “Thanks,” said Harry, pushing his sweaty hair out his eyes.
   “What's that?” said one twins suddenly, pointing Harry's lightning scar.
   “Blimey,” said other twin. “Are you—”
   “He is,” said first twin. “Aren't you?” he added Harry.
   “What?” said Harry.
   “Harry Potter,” chorused twins.
   “Oh, him,” said Harry. “I mean, yes, I am.”
   two boys gawked him, and Harry felt himself turning red. Then, his relief, voice came floating through train's open door.
   “Fred? George? Are you there?”
   “Coming, Mom.”
   last look Harry, twins hopped off train.
   Harry sat down next window where, half hidden, he could watch red haired family platform and hear what they were saying. Their mother had just taken out her handkerchief.
   “Ron, you've got something your nose.”
   youngest boy tried jerk out way, but she grabbed him and began rubbing end his nose.
   “Mom—geroff—” He wriggled free.
   “Aaah, has ickle Ronnie got somefink his nosie?” said one twins.
   “Shut up,” said Ron.
   “Where's Percy?” said their mother.
   “He's coming now.”
   oldest boy came striding sight. He had already changed his billowing black Hogwarts robes, and Harry noticed shiny silver badge his chest letter P it.
   “Can't stay long, Mother,” he said. “I'm up front, prefects have got two compartments themselves—”
   “Oh, are you prefect, Percy?” said one twins, an air great surprise. “You should have said something, we had no idea.”
   “Hang on, I think I remember him saying something it,” said other twin. “Once—”
   “Or twice—”
   “A minute—”
   “All summer—”
   “Oh, shut up,” said Percy Prefect.
   “How come Percy gets new robes, anyway?” said one twins.
   “Because he's prefect,” said their mother fondly. “All right, dear, well, have good term—send me an owl when you get there.”
   She kissed Percy cheek and he left. Then she turned twins.
   “Now, you two—this year, you behave yourselves. If I get one more owl telling me you've—you've blown up toilet or—”
   “Blown up toilet? We've never blown up toilet.”
   “Great idea though, thanks, Mom.”
   “It's not funny. And look after Ron.”
   “Don't worry, ickle Ronniekins is safe us.”
   “Shut up,” said Ron again. He was almost tall twins already and his nose was still pink where his mother had rubbed it.
   “Hey, Mom, guess what? Guess who we just met train?”
   Harry leaned back quickly so they couldn't see him looking.
   “You know that black haired boy who was near us station? Know who he is?”
   “Who?”
   “Harry Potter!”
   Harry heard little girl's voice.
   “Oh, Mom, can I go train and see him, Mom, eh please…”
   “You've already seen him, Ginny, and poor boy isn't something you goggle zoo. Is he really, Fred? How do you know?”
   “Asked him. Saw his scar. It's really there—like lightning.”
   “Poor dear—no wonder he was alone, I wondered. He was ever so polite when he asked how get onto platform.”
   “Never mind that, do you think he remembers what You-Know-Who looks like?”
   Their mother suddenly became very stern.
   “I forbid you ask him, Fred. No, don't you dare. though he needs reminding that his first day school.”
   “All right, keep your hair on.”
   whistle sounded.
   “Hurry up!” their mother said, and three boys clambered onto train. They leaned out window her kiss them good bye, and their younger sister began cry.
   “Don't, Ginny, we'll send you loads owls.”
   “We'll send you Hogwarts toilet seat.”
   “George!”
   “Only joking, Mom.”
   train began move. Harry saw boys' mother waving and their sister, half laughing, half crying, running keep up train until it gathered too much speed, then she fell back and waved.
   Harry watched girl and her mother disappear train rounded corner. Houses flashed past window. Harry felt great leap excitement. He didn't know what he was going but it had be better than what he was leaving behind.
   door compartment slid open and youngest redheaded boy came in.
   “Anyone sitting there?” he asked, pointing seat opposite Harry. “Everywhere else is full.”
   Harry shook his head and boy sat down. He glanced Harry and then looked quickly out window, pretending he hadn't looked. Harry saw he still had black mark his nose.
   “Hey, Ron.”
   twins were back.
   “Listen, we're going down middle train—Lee Jordan's got giant tarantula down there.”
   “Right,” mumbled Ron.
   “Harry,” said other twin, “did we introduce ourselves? Fred and George Weasley. And this is Ron, our brother. See you later, then.”
   “Bye,” said Harry and Ron. twins slid compartment door shut behind them.
   “Are you really Harry Potter?” Ron blurted out.
   Harry nodded.
   “Oh well, I thought it might be one Fred and George's jokes,” said Ron. “And have you really got—you know…”
   He pointed Harry's forehead.
   Harry pulled back his bangs show lightning scar. Ron stared.
   “So that's where You-Know-Who—?”
   “Yes,” said Harry, “but I can't remember it.”
   “Nothing?” said Ron eagerly.
   “Well—I remember lot green light, but nothing else.”
   “Wow,” said Ron. He sat and stared Harry few moments, then, though he had suddenly realized what he was doing, he looked quickly out window again.
   “Are all your family wizards?” asked Harry, who found Ron just interesting Ron found him.
   “Er—Yes, I think so,” said Ron. “I think Mom's got second cousin who's an accountant, but we never talk him.”
   “So you must know loads magic already.”
   Weasleys were clearly one those old wizarding families pale boy Diagon Alley had talked about.
   “I heard you went live Muggles,” said Ron. “What are they like?”
   “Horrible—well, not all them. My aunt and uncle and cousin are, though. Wish I'd had three wizard brothers.”
   “Five,” said Ron. some reason, he was looking gloomy. “I'm sixth our family go Hogwarts. You could say I've got lot live up to. Bill and Charlie have already left—Bill was head boy and Charlie was captain Quidditch. Now Percy's prefect. Fred and George mess around lot, but they still get really good marks and everyone thinks they're really funny. Everyone expects me do well others, but if I do, it's no big deal, because they did it first. You never get anything new, either, five brothers. I've got Bill's old robes, Charlie's old wand, and Percy's old rat.”
   Ron reached inside his jacket and pulled out fat gray rat, which was asleep.
   “His name's Scabbers and he's useless, he hardly ever wakes up. Percy got an owl my dad being made prefect, but they couldn't aff—I mean, I got Scabbers instead.”
   Ron's ears went pink. He seemed think he'd said too much, because he went back staring out window.
   Harry didn't think there was anything wrong not being able afford an owl. After all, he'd never had any money his life until month ago, and he told Ron so, all having wear Dudley's old clothes and never getting proper birthday presents. This seemed cheer Ron up.
   “…and until Hagrid told me, I didn't know anything being wizard or my parents or Voldemort—”
   Ron gasped.
   “What?” said Harry.
   “You said You-Know-Who's name!” said Ron, sounding both shocked and impressed. “I'd have thought you, all people—”
   “I'm not trying be brave or anything, saying name,” said Harry, “I just never knew you shouldn't. See what I mean? I've got loads learn… I bet,” he added, voicing first time something that had been worrying him lot lately, “I bet I'm worst class.”
   “You won't be. There's loads people who come Muggle families and they learn quick enough.”
   While they had been talking, train had carried them out London. Now they were speeding past fields full cows and sheep. They were quiet time, watching fields and lanes flick past.
   Around half past twelve there was great clattering outside corridor and smiling, dimpled woman slid back their door and said, “Anything off cart, dears?”
   Harry, who hadn't had any breakfast, leapt his feet, but Ron's ears went pink again and he muttered that he'd brought sandwiches. Harry went out corridor.
   He had never had any money candy Dursleys, and now that he had pockets rattling gold and silver he was ready buy many Mars Bars he could carry—but woman didn't have Mars Bars. What she did have were Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans, Drooble's Best Blowing Gum, Chocolate Frogs. Pumpkin Pasties, Cauldron Cakes, Licorice Wands, and number other strange things Harry had never seen his life. Not wanting miss anything, he got some everything and paid woman eleven silver Sickles and seven bronze Knuts.
   Ron stared Harry brought it all back compartment and tipped it onto an empty seat.
   “Hungry, are you?”
   “Starving,” said Harry, taking large bite out pumpkin pasty.
   Ron had taken out lumpy package and unwrapped it. There were four sandwiches inside. He pulled one them apart and said, “She always forgets I don't like corned beef.”
   “Swap you one these,” said Harry, holding up pasty. “Go on—”
   “You don't want this, it's all dry,” said Ron. “She hasn't got much time,” he added quickly, “you know, five us.”
   “Go on, have pasty,” said Harry, who had never had anything share before or, indeed, anyone share it with. It was nice feeling, sitting there Ron, eating their way through all Harry's pasties, cakes, and candies (the sandwiches lay forgotten).
   “What are these?” Harry asked Ron, holding up pack Chocolate Frogs. “They're not really frogs, are they?” He was starting feel that nothing would surprise him.
   “No,” said Ron. “But see what card is. I'm missing Agrippa.”
   “What?”
   “Oh, course, you wouldn't know—Chocolate Frogs have cards, inside them, you know, collect—famous witches and wizards. I've got five hundred, but I haven't got Agrippa or Ptolemy.”
   Harry unwrapped his Chocolate Frog and picked up card. It showed man's face. He wore half-moon glasses, had long, crooked nose, and flowing silver hair, beard, and mustache. Underneath picture was name Albus Dumbledore.
   “So this is Dumbledore!” said Harry.
   “Don't tell me you'd never heard Dumbledore!” said Ron. “Can I have frog? I might get Agrippa—thanks—”
   Harry turned over his card and read:
   
    ALBUS DUMBLEDORE
    CURRENTLY HEADMASTER HOGWARTS
    Considered by many greatest wizard modern times, Dumbledore is particularly famous his defeat dark wizard Grindelwald 1945, discovery twelve uses dragon's blood, and his work alchemy his partner, Nicolas Flamel. Professor Dumbledore enjoys chamber music and tenpin bowling.
   
   Harry turned card back over and saw, his astonishment, that Dumbledore's face had disappeared.
   “He's gone!”
   “Well, you can't expect him hang around all day,” said Ron. “He'll be back. No, I've got Morgana again and I've got six her… do you want it? You can start collecting.”
   Ron's eyes strayed pile Chocolate Frogs waiting be unwrapped.
   “Help yourself,” said Harry. “But in, you know, Muggle world, people just stay put photos.”
   “Do they? What, they don't move all?” Ron sounded amazed. “Weird!”
   Harry stared Dumbledore sidled back picture his card and gave him small smile. Ron was more interested eating frogs than looking Famous Witches and Wizards cards, but Harry couldn't keep his eyes off them. Soon he had not only Dumbledore and Morgana, but Hengist Woodcroft, Alberic Grunnion, Circe, Paracelsus, and Merlin. He finally tore his eyes away druidess Cliodna, who was scratching her nose, open bag Bertie Bott's Every Flavor Beans.
   “You want be careful those,” Ron warned Harry. “When they say every flavor, they mean every flavor—you know, you get all ordinary ones like chocolate and peppermint and marmalade, but then you can get spinach and liver and tripe. George reckons he had booger-flavored one once.”
   Ron picked up green bean, looked it carefully, and bit corner.
   “Bleaaargh—see? Sprouts.”
   They had good time eating Every Flavor Beans. Harry got toast, coconut, baked bean, strawberry, curry, grass, coffee, sardine, and was even brave enough nibble end off funny gray one Ron wouldn't touch, which turned out be pepper.
   countryside now flying past window was becoming wilder. neat fields had gone. Now there were woods, twisting rivers, and dark green hills.
   There was knock door their compartment and round faced boy Harry had passed platform nine and threequarters came in. He looked tearful.
   “Sorry,” he said, “but have you seen toad all?”
   When they shook their heads, he wailed, “I've lost him! He keeps getting away me!”
   “He'll turn up,” said Harry.
   “Yes,” said boy miserably. “Well, if you see him…”
   He left.
   “Don't know why he's so bothered,” said Ron. “If I'd brought toad I'd lose it quick I could. Mind you, I brought Scabbers, so I can't talk.”
   rat was still snoozing Ron's lap.
   “He might have died and you wouldn't know difference,” said Ron disgust. “I tried turn him yellow yesterday make him more interesting, but spell didn't work. I'll show you, look…”
   He rummaged around his trunk and pulled out very battered looking wand. It was chipped places and something white was glinting end.
   “Unicorn hair's nearly poking out. Anyway—”
   He had just raised his wand when compartment door slid open again. toadless boy was back, but this time he had girl him. She was already wearing her new Hogwarts robes.
   “Has anyone seen toad? Neville's lost one,” she said. She had bossy sort voice, lots bushy brown hair, and rather large front teeth.
   “We've already told him we haven't seen it,” said Ron, but girl wasn't listening, she was looking wand his hand.
   “Oh, are you doing magic? Let's see it, then.”
   She sat down. Ron looked taken aback.
   “Er—all right.”
   He cleared his throat.
   
    
     “Sunshine, daisies, butter mellow,

     Turn this stupid, fat rat yellow.”

    

   
   He waved his wand, but nothing happened. Scabbers stayed gray and fast asleep.
   “Are you sure that's real spell?” said girl. “Well, it's not very good, is it? I've tried few simple spells just practice and it's all worked me. Nobody my family's magic all, it was ever such surprise when I got my letter, but I was ever so pleased, course, I mean, it's very best school witchcraft there is, I've heard—I've learned all our course books by heart, course, I just hope it will be enough—I'm Hermione Granger, by way, who are you?”
   She said all this very fast.
   Harry looked Ron, and was relieved see by his stunned face that he hadn't learned all course books by heart either.
   “I'm Ron Weasley,” Ron muttered.
   “Harry Potter,” said Harry.
   “Are you really?” said Hermione. “I know all you, course—I got few extra books background reading, and you're Modern Magical History and Rise and Fall Dark Arts and Great Wizarding Events Twentieth Century.”
   “Am I?” said Harry, feeling dazed.
   “Goodness, didn't you know, I'd have found out everything I could if it was me,” said Hermione. “Do either you know what house you'll be in? I've been asking around, and I hope I'm Gryffindor, it sounds by far best; I hear Dumbledore himself was it, but I suppose Ravenclaw wouldn't be too bad… Anyway, we'd better go and look Neville's toad. You two had better change, you know, I expect we'll be there soon.”
   And she left, taking toadless boy her.
   “Whatever house I'm in, I hope she's not it,” said Ron. He threw his wand back his trunk. “Stupid spell—George gave it me, bet he knew it was dud.”
   “What house are your brothers in?” asked Harry.
   “Gryffindor,” said Ron. Gloom seemed be settling him again. “Mom and Dad were it, too. I don't know what they'll say if I'm not. I don't suppose Ravenclaw would be too bad, but imagine if they put me Slytherin.”
   “That's house Vol—, I mean, You-Know-Who was in?”
   “Yeah,” said Ron. He flopped back his seat, looking depressed.
   “You know, I think ends Scabbers' whiskers are bit lighter,” said Harry, trying take Ron's mind off houses. “So what do your oldest brothers do now that they've left, anyway?”
   Harry was wondering what wizard did once he'd finished school.
   “Charlie's Romania studying dragons, and Bill's Africa doing something Gringotts,” said Ron. “Did you hear Gringotts? It's been all over Daily Prophet, but I don't suppose you get that Muggles—someone tried rob high security vault.”
   Harry stared.
   “Really? What happened them?”
   “Nothing, that's why it's such big news. They haven't been caught. My dad says it must've been powerful Dark wizard get round Gringotts, but they don't think they took anything, that's what's odd. 'Course, everyone gets scared when something like this happens case You-Know-Who's behind it.”
   Harry turned this news over his mind. He was starting get prickle fear every time You-Know-Who was mentioned. He supposed this was all part entering magical world, but it had been lot more comfortable saying “Voldemort” without worrying.
   “What's your favorite Quidditch team?” Ron asked.
   “Er—I don't know any,” Harry confessed.
   “What!” Ron looked dumbfounded. “Oh, you wait, it's best game world—” And he was off, explaining all four balls and positions seven players, describing famous games he'd been his brothers and broomstick he'd like get if he had money. He was just taking Harry through finer points game when compartment door slid open yet again, but it wasn't Neville toadless boy, or Hermione Granger this time.
   Three boys entered, and Harry recognized middle one once: it was pale boy Madam Malkin's robe shop. He was looking Harry lot more interest than he'd shown back Diagon Alley.
   “Is it true?” he said. “They're saying all down train that Harry Potter's this compartment. So it's you, is it?”
   “Yes,” said Harry. He was looking other boys. Both them were thickset and looked extremely mean. Standing either side pale boy, they looked like bodyguards.
   “Oh, this is Crabbe and this is Goyle,” said pale boy carelessly, noticing where Harry was looking. “And my name's Malfoy, Draco Malfoy.”
   Ron gave slight cough, which might have been hiding snigget. Draco Malfoy looked him.
   “Think my name's funny, do you? No need ask who you are. My father told me all Weasleys have red hair, freckles, and more children than they can afford.”
   He turned back Harry. “You'll soon find out some wizarding families are much better than others, Potter. You don't want go making friends wrong sort. I can help you there.”
   He held out his hand shake Harry's, but Harry didn't take it.
   “I think I can tell who wrong sort are myself, thanks,” he said coolly.
   Draco Malfoy didn't go red, but pink tinge appeared his pale cheeks.
   “I'd be careful if I were you, Potter,” he said slowly. “Unless you're bit politer you'll go same way your parents. They didn't know what was good them, either. You hang around riffraff like Weasleys and that Hagrid, and it'll rub off you.”
   Both Harry and Ron stood up.
   “Say that again,” Ron said, his face red his hair.
   “Oh, you're going fight us, are you?” Malfoy sneered.
   “Unless you get out now,” said Harry, more bravely than he felt, because Crabbe and Goyle were lot bigger than him or Ron.
   “But we don't feet like leaving, do we, boys? We've eaten all our food and you still seem have some.”
   Goyle reached toward Chocolate Frogs next Ron—Ron leapt forward, but before he'd so much touched Goyle, Goyle let out horrible yell.
   Scabbers rat was hanging off his finger, sharp little teeth sunk deep Goyle's knuckle—Crabbe and Malfoy backed away Goyle swung Scabbers round and round, howling, and when Scabbers finally flew off and hit window, all three them disappeared once. Perhaps they thought there were more rats lurking among sweets, or perhaps they'd heard footsteps, because second later, Hermione Granger had come in.
   “What has been going on?” she said, looking sweets all over floor and Ron picking up Scabbers by his tail.
   “I think he's been knocked out,” Ron said Harry. He looked closer Scabbers. “No—I don't believe it—he's gone back sleep—”
   And so he had.
   “You've met Malfoy before?”
   Harry explained their meeting Diagon Alley.
   “I've heard his family,” said Ron darkly. “They were some first come back our side after You-Know-Who disappeared. Said they'd been bewitched. My dad doesn't believe it. He says Malfoy's father didn't need an excuse go over Dark Side.” He turned Hermione. “Can we help you something?”
   “You'd better hurry up and put your robes on, I've just been up front ask conductor, and he says we're nearly there. You haven't been fighting, have you? You'll be trouble before we even get there!”
   “Scabbers has been fighting, not us,” said Ron, scowling her. “Would you mind leaving while we change?”
   “All right—I only came here because people outside are behaving very childishly, racing up and down corridors,” said Hermione sniffy voice. “And you've got dirt your nose, by way, did you know?”
   Ron glared her she left. Harry peered out window. It was getting dark. He could see mountains and forests under deep purple sky. train did seem be slowing down.
   He and Ron took off their jackets and pulled their long black robes. Ron's were bit short him, you could see his sneakers underneath them.
   voice echoed through train: “We will be reaching Hogwarts five minutes' time. Please leave your luggage train, it will be taken school separately.”
   Harry's stomach lurched nerves and Ron, he saw, looked pale under his freckles. They crammed their pockets last sweets and joined crowd thronging corridor.
   train slowed right down and finally stopped. People pushed their way toward door and out tiny, dark platform. Harry shivered cold night air. Then lamp came bobbing over heads students, and Harry heard familiar voice: “Firs' years! Firs' years over here! All right there, Harry?”
   Hagrid's big hairy face beamed over sea heads.
   “C'mon, follow me—any more firs' years? Mind yer step, now! Firs' years follow me!”
   Slipping and stumbling, they followed Hagrid down what seemed be steep, narrow path. It was so dark either side them that Harry thought there must be thick trees there. Nobody spoke much. Neville, boy who kept losing his toad, sniffed once or twice.
   “Ye' all get yer firs' sight o' Hogwarts sec,” Hagrid called over his shoulder, “jus' round this bend here.”
   There was loud “Oooooh!”
   narrow path had opened suddenly onto edge great black take. Perched atop high mountain other side, its windows sparkling starry sky, was vast castle many turrets and towers.
   “No more'n four boat!” Hagrid called, pointing fleet little boats sitting water by shore. Harry and Ron were followed their boat by Neville and Hermione.
   “Everyone in?” shouted Hagrid, who had boat himself. “Right then—FORWARD!”
   And fleet little boats moved off all once, gliding across lake, which was smooth glass. Everyone was silent, staring up great castle overhead. It towered over them they sailed nearer and nearer cliff which it stood.
   “Heads down!” yelled Hagrid first boats reached cliff; they all bent their heads and little boats carried them through curtain ivy that hid wide opening cliff face. They were carried along dark tunnel, which seemed be taking them right underneath castle, until they reached kind underground harbor, where they clambered out onto rocks and pebbles.
   “Oy, you there! Is this your toad?” said Hagrid, who was checking boats people climbed out them.
   “Trevor!” cried Neville blissfully, holding out his hands. Then they clambered up passageway rock after Hagrid's lamp, coming out last onto smooth, damp grass right shadow castle.
   They walked up flight stone steps and crowded around huge, oak front door.
   “Everyone here? You there, still got yer toad?”
   Hagrid raised gigantic fist and knocked three times castle door.
  

  

   

    7. SORTING HAT
   

   door swung open once. tall, black haired witch emerald green robes stood there. She had very stern face and Harry's first thought was that this was not someone cross.
   “The firs' years, Professor McGonagall,” said Hagrid.
   “Thank you, Hagrid. I will take them here.”
   She pulled door wide. entrance hall was so big you could have fit whole Dursleys' house it. stone walls were lit flaming torches like ones Gringotts, ceiling was too high make out, and magnificent marble staircase facing them led upper floors.
   They followed Professor McGonagall across flagged stone floor. Harry could hear drone hundreds voices doorway right rest school must already be here—but Professor McGonagall showed first years small, empty chamber off hall. They crowded in, standing rather closer together than they would usually have done, peering nervously.
   “Welcome Hogwarts,” said Professor McGonagall. “The start term banquet will begin shortly, but before you take your seats Great Hall, you will be sorted your houses. Sorting is very important ceremony because, while you are here, your house will be something like your family within Hogwarts. You will have classes rest your house, sleep your house dormitory, and spend free time your house common room.
   “The four houses are called Gryffindor, Hufflepuff, Ravenclaw, and Slytherin. Each house has its own noble history and each has produced outstanding witches and wizards. While you are Hogwarts, your triumphs will earn your house points, while any rulebreaking will lose house points. end year, house most points is awarded house cup, great honor. I hope each you will be credit whichever house becomes yours.
   “The Sorting Ceremony will take place few minutes front rest school. I suggest you all smarten yourselves up much you can while you are waiting.”
   Her eyes lingered moment Neville's cloak, which was fastened under his left ear, and Ron's smudged nose. Harry nervously tried flatten his hair.
   “I shall return when we are ready you,” said Professor McGonagall. “Please wait quietly.”
   She left chamber. Harry swallowed.
   “How exactly do they sort us houses?” he asked Ron.
   “Some sort test, I think. Fred said it hurts lot, but I think he was joking.”
   Harry's heart gave horrible jolt. test? front whole school? But he didn't know any magic yet—what earth would he have do? He hadn't expected something like this moment they arrived. He looked around anxiously and saw that everyone else looked terrified, too. No one was talking much except Hermione Granger, who was whispering very fast all spells she'd learned and wondering which one she'd need. Harry tried hard not listen her. He'd never been more nervous, never, not even when he'd had take school report home Dursleys saying that he'd somehow turned his teacher's wig blue. He kept his eyes fixed door. Any second now, Professor McGonagall would come back and lead him his doom.
   Then something happened that made him jump foot air—several people behind him screamed.
   “What the—?”
   He gasped. So did people around him. twenty ghosts had just streamed through back wall. Pearly white and slightly transparent, they glided across room talking one another and hardly glancing first years. They seemed be arguing. What looked like fat little monk was saying: “Forgive and forget, I say, we ought give him second chance—”
   “My dear Friar, haven't we given Peeves all chances he deserves? He gives us all bad name and you know, he's not really even ghost—I say, what are you all doing here?”
   ghost wearing ruff and tights had suddenly noticed first years.
   Nobody answered.
   “New students!” said Fat Friar, smiling around them. “About be Sorted, I suppose?”
   few people nodded mutely.
   “Hope see you Hufflepuff!” said Friar. “My old house, you know.”
   “Move along now,” said sharp voice. “The Sorting Ceremony's start.”
   Professor McGonagall had returned. One by one, ghosts floated away through opposite wall.
   “Now, form line,” Professor McGonagall told first years, “and follow me.”
   Feeling oddly though his legs had turned lead, Harry got line behind boy sandy hair, Ron behind him, and they walked out chamber, back across hall, and through pair double doors Great Hall.
   Harry had never even imagined such strange and splendid place. It was lit by thousands and thousands candles that were floating midair over four long tables, where rest students were sitting. These tables were laid glittering golden plates and goblets. top hall was another long table where teachers were sitting. Professor McGonagall led first years up here, so that they came halt line facing other students, teachers behind them. hundreds faces staring them looked like pale lanterns flickering candlelight. Dotted here and there among students, ghosts shone misty silver. Mainly avoid all staring eyes, Harry looked upward and saw velvety black ceiling dotted stars. He heard Hermione whisper, “It's bewitched look like sky outside. I read it Hogwarts, History.”
   It was hard believe there was ceiling there all, and that Great Hall didn't simply open heavens.
   Harry quickly looked down again Professor McGonagall silently placed four legged stool front first years. top stool she put pointed wizard's hat. This hat was patched and frayed and extremely dirty. Aunt Petunia wouldn't have let it house.
   Maybe they had try and get rabbit out it, Harry thought wildly, that seemed sort thing—noticing that everyone hall was now staring hat, he stared it, too. few seconds, there was complete silence. Then hat twitched. rip near brim opened wide like mouth—and hat began sing:
   
    
     “Oh, you may not think I'm pretty,

     But don't judge what you see,

     I'll eat myself if you can find

     smarter hat than me.

    

    
     You can keep your bowlers black,

     Your top hats sleek and tall,

     I'm Hogwarts Sorting Hat

     And I can cap them all.

    

    
     There's nothing hidden your head

     Sorting Hat can't see,

     So try me and I will tell you

     Where you ought be.

    

    
     You might belong Gryffindor,

     Where dwell brave heart,

     Their daring, nerve, and chivalry

     Set Gryffindors apart;

    

    
     You might belong Hufflepuff,

     Where they are just and loyal,

     Those patient Hufflepuffs are true

     And unafraid toil;

    

    
     Or yet wise old Ravenclaw,

     If you've ready mind,

     Where those wit and learning,

     Will always find their kind;

    

    
     Or perhaps Slytherin

     You'll make your real friends,

     Those cunning folk use any means

     achieve their ends.

    

    
     So put me on! Don't be afraid!

     And don't get flap!

     You're safe hands (though I have none)

     I'm Thinking Cap!”

    

   
   whole hall burst applause hat finished its song. It bowed each four tables and then became quite still again.
   “So we've just got try hat!” Ron whispered Harry. “I'll kill Fred, he was going wrestling troll.”
   Harry smiled weakly. Yes, trying hat was lot better than having do spell, but he did wish they could have tried it without everyone watching. hat seemed be asking rather lot; Harry didn't feel brave or quick witted or any it moment. If only hat had mentioned house people who felt bit queasy, that would have been one him.
   Professor McGonagall now stepped forward holding long roll parchment.
   “When I call your name, you will put hat and sit stool be sorted,” she said. “Abbott, Hannah!”
   pink faced girl blonde pigtails stumbled out line, put hat, which fell right down over her eyes, and sat down. moments pause—
   “HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted hat.
   table right cheered and clapped Hannah went sit down Hufflepuff table. Harry saw ghost Fat Friar waving merrily her.
   “Bones, Susan!”
   “HUFFLEPUFF!” shouted hat again, and Susan scuttled off sit next Hannah.
   “Boot, Terry!”
   “RAVENCLAW!”
   table second left clapped this time; several Ravenclaws stood up shake hands Terry he joined them.
   “Brocklehurst, Mandy” went Ravenclaw too, but “Brown, Lavender” became first new Gryffindor, and table far left exploded cheers; Harry could see Ron's twin brothers catcalling.
   “Bulstrode, Millicent” then became Slytherin. Perhaps it was Harry's imagination, after all he'd heard Slytherin, but he thought they looked like an unpleasant lot. He was starting feel definitely sick now. He remembered being picked teams during gym his old school. He had always been last be chosen, not because he was no good, but because no one wanted Dudley think they liked him.
   “Finch-Fletchley, Justin!”
   “HUFFLEPUFF!”
   Sometimes, Harry noticed, hat shouted out house once, but others it took little while decide. “Finnigan, Seamus,” sandy haired boy next Harry line, sat stool almost whole minute before hat declared him Gryffindor.
   “Granger, Hermione!”
   Hermione almost ran stool and jammed hat eagerly her head.
   “GRYFFINDOR!” shouted hat. Ron groaned.
   horrible thought struck Harry, horrible thoughts always do when you're very nervous. What if he wasn't chosen all? What if he just sat there hat over his eyes ages, until Professor McGonagall jerked it off his head and said there had obviously been mistake and he'd better get back train?
   When Neville Longbottom, boy who kept losing his toad, was called, he fell over his way stool. hat took long time decide Neville. When it finally shouted, “GRYFFINDOR,” Neville ran off still wearing it, and had jog back amid gales laughter give it “MacDougal, Morag.”
   Malfoy swaggered forward when his name was called and got his wish once: hat had barely touched his head when it screamed, “SLYTHERIN!”
   Malfoy went join his friends Crabbe and Goyle, looking pleased himself.
   There weren't many people left now. “Moon”…, “Nott”…, “Parkinson”…, then pair twin girls, “Patil” and “Patil”…, then “Perks, Sally Anne”…, and then, last—
   “Potter, Harry!”
   Harry stepped forward, whispers suddenly broke out like little hissing fires all over hall.
   “Potter, did she say?”
   “The Harry Potter?”
   last thing Harry saw before hat dropped over his eyes was hall full people craning get good look him. Next second he was looking black inside hat. He waited.
   “Hmm,” said small voice his ear. “Difficult. Very difficult. Plenty courage, I see. Not bad mind either. There's talent, ah my goodness, yes—and nice thirst prove yourself, now that's interesting… So where shall I put you?”
   Harry gripped edges stool and thought, Not Slytherin, not Slytherin.
   “Not Slytherin, eh?” said small voice. “Are you sure? You could be great, you know, it's all here your head, and Slytherin will help you way greatness, no doubt that—no? Well, if you're sure—better be GRYFFINDOR!”
   Harry heard hat shout last word whole hall. He took off hat and walked shakily toward Gryffindor table. He was so relieved have been chosen and not put Slytherin, he hardly noticed that he was getting loudest cheer yet. Percy Prefect got up and shook his hand vigorously, while Weasley twins yelled, “We got Potter! We got Potter!” Harry sat down opposite ghost ruff he'd seen earlier. ghost patted his arm, giving Harry sudden, horrible feeling he'd just plunged it bucket ice cold water.
   He could see High Table properly now. end nearest him sat Hagrid, who caught his eye and gave him thumbs up. Harry grinned back. And there, center High Table, large gold chair, sat Albus Dumbledore. Harry recognized him once card he'd gotten out Chocolate Frog train. Dumbledore's silver hair was only thing whole hall that shone brightly ghosts. Harry spotted Professor Quirtell, too, nervous young man Leaky Cauldron. He was looking very peculiar large purple turban.
   And now there were only three people left be sorted. “Thomas, Dean,” black boy even taller than Ron, joined Harry Gryffindor table. “Turpin, Lisa,” became Ravenclaw and then it was Ron's turn. He was pale green by now. Harry crossed his fingers under table and second later hat had shouted, “GRYFFINDOR!”
   Harry clapped loudly rest Ron collapsed chair next him.
   “Well done, Ron, excellent,” said Percy Weasley Pompously across Harry “Zabini, Blaise,” was made Slytherin. Professor McGonagall rolled up her scroll and took Sorting Hat away.
   Harry looked down his empty gold plate. He had only just realized how hungry he was. pumpkin pasties seemed ages ago.
   Albus Dumbledore had gotten his feet. He was beaming students, his arms opened wide, if nothing could have pleased him more than see them all there.
   “Welcome,” he said. “Welcome new year Hogwarts! Before we begin our banquet, I would like say few words. And here they are: Nitwit! Blubber! Oddment! Tweak!
   “Thank you!”
   He sat back down. Everybody clapped and cheered. Harry didn't know whether laugh or not.
   “Is he—a bit mad?” he asked Percy uncertainly.
   “Mad?” said Percy airily. “He's genius! Best wizard world! But he is bit mad, yes. Potatoes, Harry?”
   Harry's mouth fell open. dishes front him were now piled food. He had never seen so many things he liked eat one table: roast beef, roast chicken, pork chops and lamb chops, sausages, bacon and steak, boiled potatoes, roast potatoes, fries, Yorkshire pudding, peas, carrots, gravy, ketchup, and, some strange reason, peppermint humbugs.
   Dursleys had never exactly starved Harry, but he'd never been allowed eat much he liked. Dudley had always taken anything that Harry really wanted, even if It made him sick. Harry piled his plate bit everything except peppermints and began eat. It was all delicious.
   “That does look good,” said ghost ruff sadly, watching Harry cut up his steak, “Can't you—?”
   “I haven't eaten nearly four hundred years,” said ghost. “I don't need to, course, but one does miss it. I don't think I've introduced myself? Sir Nicholas de Mimsy Porpington your service. Resident ghost Gryffindor Tower.”
   “I know who you are!” said Ron suddenly. “My brothers told me you—you're Nearly Headless Nick!”
   “I would prefer you call me Sir Nicholas de Mimsy—” ghost began stiffly, but sandy haired Seamus Finnigan interrupted.
   “Nearly Headless? How can you be nearly headless?”
   Sir Nicholas looked extremely miffed, if their little chat wasn't going all way he wanted.
   “Like this,” he said irritably. He seized his left ear and pulled. His whole head swung off his neck and fell onto his shoulder if it was hinge. Someone had obviously tried behead him, but not done it properly. Looking pleased stunned looks their faces, Nearly Headless Nick flipped his head back onto his neck, coughed, and said, “So—new Gryffindors! I hope you're going help us win house championship this year? Gryffindors have never gone so long without winning. Slytherins have got cup six years row! Bloody Baron's becoming almost unbearable—he's Slytherin ghost.”
   Harry looked over Slytherin table and saw horrible ghost sitting there, blank staring eyes, gaunt face, and robes stained silver blood. He was right next Malfoy who, Harry was pleased see, didn't look too pleased seating arrangements.
   “How did he get covered blood?” asked Seamus great interest.
   “I've never asked,” said Nearly Headless Nick delicately.
   When everyone had eaten much they could, remains food faded plates, leaving them sparkling clean before. moment later desserts appeared. Blocks ice cream every flavor you could think of, apple pies, treacle tarts, chocolate eclairs and jam doughnuts, trifle, strawberries, Jell-O, rice pudding—”
   Harry helped himself treacle tart, talk turned their families.
   “I'm half-and-half,” said Seamus. “Me dad's Muggle. Mom didn't tell him she was witch 'til after they were married. Bit nasty shock him.”
   others laughed.
   “What you, Neville?” said Ron.
   “Well, my gran brought me up and she's witch,” said Neville, “but family thought I was all-Muggle ages. My Great Uncle Algie kept trying catch me off my guard and force some magic out me—he pushed me off end Blackpool pier once, I nearly drowned—but nothing happened until I was eight. Great Uncle Algie came round dinner, and he was hanging me out an upstairs window by ankles when my Great Auntie Enid offered him meringue and he accidentally let go. But I bounced—all way down garden and road. They were all really pleased, Gran was crying, she was so happy. And you should have seen their faces when I got here—they thought I might not be magic enough come, you see. Great Uncle Algie was so pleased he bought me my toad.”
   Harry's other side, Percy Weasley and Hermione were talking lessons (“I do hope they start right away, there's so much learn, I'm particularly interested Transfiguration, you know, turning something something else, course, it's supposed be very difficult”; “You'll be starting small, just matches needles and that sort thing—”).
   Harry, who was starting feel warm and sleepy, looked up High Table again. Hagrid was drinking deeply his goblet. Professor McGonagall was talking Professor Dumbledore. Professor Quirrell, his absurd turban, was talking teacher greasy black hair, hooked nose, and sallow skin.
   It happened very suddenly. hook nosed teacher looked past Quirrell's turban straight Harry's eyes—and sharp, hot pain shot across scar Harry's forehead.
   “Ouch!” Harry clapped hand his head.
   “What is it?” asked Percy.
   “N-nothing.”
   pain had gone quickly it had come. Harder shake off was feeling Harry had gotten teacher's look—a feeling that he didn't like Harry all.
   “Who's that teacher talking Professor Quirrell?” he asked Percy.
   “Oh, you know Quirrell already, do you? No wonder he's looking so nervous, that's Professor Snape. He teaches Potions, but he doesn't want to—everyone knows he's after Quirrell's job. Knows an awful lot Dark Arts, Snape.”
   Harry watched Snape while, but Snape didn't look him again.
   last, desserts too disappeared, and Professor Dumbledore got his feet again. hall fell silent.
   “Ahem—just few more words now that we are all fed and watered. I have few start term notices give you.
   “First years should note that forest grounds is forbidden all pupils. And few our older students would do well remember that well.”
   Dumbledore's twinkling eyes flashed direction Weasley twins.
   “I have also been asked by Mr. Filch, caretaker, remind you all that no magic should be used between classes corridors.
   “Quidditch trials will be held second week term. Anyone interested playing their house teams should contact Madam Hooch.
   “And finally, I must tell you that this year, third floor corridor right hand side is out bounds everyone who does not wish die very painful death.”
   Harry laughed, but he was one few who did.
   “He's not serious?” he muttered Percy.
   “Must be,” said Percy, frowning Dumbledore. “It's odd, because he usually gives us reason why we're not allowed go somewhere—the forest's full dangerous beasts, everyone knows that. I do think he might have told us prefects, least.”
   “And now, before we go bed, let us sing school song!” cried Dumbledore. Harry noticed that other teachers' smiles had become rather fixed.
   Dumbledore gave his wand little flick, if he was trying get fly off end, and long golden ribbon flew out it, which rose high above tables and twisted itself, snakelike, words.
   “Everyone pick their favorite tune,” said Dumbledore, “and off we go!”
   And school bellowed:
   
    
     Hogwarts, Hogwarts, Hoggy Warty Hogwarts,

     Teach us something please,

     Whether we be old and bald

     Or young scabby knees,

    

    
     Our heads could do filling

     some interesting stuff,

     now they're bare and full air,

     Dead flies and bits fluff,

    

    
     So teach us things worth knowing,

     Bring back what we've forgot,

     Just do your best, we'll do rest,

     And learn until our brains all rot.

    

   
   Everybody finished song different times. last, only Weasley twins were left singing along very slow funeral march. Dumbledore conducted their last few lines his wand and when they had finished, he was one those who clapped loudest.
   “Ah, music,” he said, wiping his eyes. “A magic beyond all we do here! And now, bedtime. Off you trot!”
   Gryffindor first years followed Percy through chattering crowds, out Great Hall, and up marble staircase. Harry's legs were like lead again, but only because he was so tired and full food. He was too sleepy even be surprised that people portraits along corridors whispered and pointed they passed, or that twice Percy led them through doorways hidden behind sliding panels and hanging tapestries. They climbed more staircases, yawning and dragging their feet, and Harry was just wondering how much farther they had go when they came sudden halt.
   bundle walking sticks was floating midair ahead them, and Percy took step toward them they started throwing themselves him.
   “Peeves,” Percy whispered first years. “A poltergeist.” He raised his voice, “Peeves—show yourself!”
   loud, rude sound, like air being let out balloon, answered.
   “Do you want me go Bloody Baron?”
   There was pop, and little man wicked, dark eyes and wide mouth appeared, floating cross-legged air, clutching walking sticks.
   “Oooooooh!” he said, an evil cackle. “Ickle Firsties! What fun!”
   He swooped suddenly them. They all ducked.
   “Go away, Peeves, or Baron'll hear this, I mean it!” barked Percy.
   Peeves stuck out his tongue and vanished, dropping walking sticks Neville's head. They heard him zooming away, rattling coats armor he passed.
   “You want watch out Peeves,” said Percy, they set off again. “The Bloody Baron's only one who can control him, he won't even listen us prefects. Here we are.”
   very end corridor hung portrait very fat woman pink silk dress.
   “Password?” she said.
   “Caput Draconis,” said Percy, and portrait swung forward reveal round hole wall. They all scrambled through it—Neville needed leg up—and found themselves Gryffindor common room, cozy, round room full squashy armchairs.
   Percy directed girls through one door their dormitory and boys through another. top spiral staircase—they were obviously one towers—they found their beds last: five four posters hung deep red, velvet curtains. Their trunks had already been brought up. Too tired talk much, they pulled their pajamas and fell bed.
   “Great food, isn't it?” Ron muttered Harry through hangings. “Get off, Scabbers! He's chewing my sheets.”
   Harry was going ask Ron if he'd had any treacle tart, but he fell asleep almost once.
   Perhaps Harry had eaten bit too much, because he had very strange dream. He was wearing Professor Quirrell's turban, which kept talking him, telling him he must transfer Slytherin once, because it was his destiny. Harry told turban he didn't want be Slytherin; it got heavier and heavier; he tried pull it off but it tightened painfully—and there was Malfoy, laughing him he struggled it—then Malfoy turned hook nosed teacher, Snape, whose laugh became high and cold—there was burst green light and Harry woke, sweating and shaking.
   He rolled over and fell asleep again, and when he woke next day, he didn't remember dream all.
  

  

   

    8. POTIONS MASTER
   

   “There, look.”
   “Where?”
   “Next tall kid red hair.”
   “Wearing glasses?”
   “Did you see his face?”
   “Did you see his scar?”
   Whispers followed Harry moment he left his dormitory next day. People lining up outside classrooms stood tiptoe get look him, or doubled back pass him corridors again, staring. Harry wished they wouldn't, because he was trying concentrate finding his way classes.
   There were hundred and forty two staircases Hogwarts: wide, sweeping ones; narrow, rickety ones; some that led somewhere different Friday; some vanishing step halfway up that you had remember jump. Then there were doors that wouldn't open unless you asked politely, or tickled them exactly right place, and doors that weren't really doors all, but solid walls just pretending. It was also very hard remember where anything was, because it all seemed move around lot. people portraits kept going visit each other, and Harry was sure coats armor could walk.
   ghosts didn't help, either. It was always nasty shock when one them glided suddenly through door you were trying open. Nearly Headless Nick was always happy point new Gryffindors right direction, but Peeves Poltergeist was worth two locked doors and trick staircase if you met him when you were late class. He would drop wastepaper baskets your head, pull rugs under your feet, pelt you bits chalk, or sneak up behind you, invisible, grab your nose, and screech, “GOT YOUR CONK!”
   Even worse than Peeves, if that was possible, was caretaker, Argus Filch. Harry and Ron managed get wrong side him their very first morning. Filch found them trying force their way through door that unluckily turned out be entrance out bounds corridor third floor. He wouldn't believe they were lost, was sure they were trying break it purpose, and was threatening lock them dungeons when they were rescued by Professor Quirrell, who was passing.
   Filch owned cat called Mrs. Norris, scrawny, dust colored creature bulging, lamp like eyes just like Filch's. She patrolled corridors alone. Break rule front her, put just one toe out line, and she'd whisk off Filch, who'd appear, wheezing, two seconds later. Filch knew secret passageways school better than anyone (except perhaps Weasley twins) and could pop up suddenly any ghosts. students all hated him, and it was dearest ambition many give Mrs. Norris good kick.
   And then, once you had managed find them, there were classes themselves. There was lot more magic, Harry quickly found out, than waving your wand and saying few funny words.
   They had study night skies through their telescopes every Wednesday midnight and learn names different stars and movements planets. Three times week they went out greenhouses behind castle study Herbology, dumpy little witch called Professor Sprout, where they learned how take care all strange plants and fungi, and found out what they were used for.
   Easily most boring class was History Magic, which was only one taught by ghost. Professor Binns had been very old indeed when he had fallen asleep front staff room fire and got up next morning teach, leaving his body behind him. Binns droned and while they scribbled down names and dates, and got Emetic Evil and Uric Oddball mixed up.
   Professor Flitwick, Charms teacher, was tiny little wizard who had stand pile books see over his desk. start their first class he took roll call, and when he reached Harry's name he gave an excited squeak and toppled out sight.
   Professor McGonagall was again different. Harry had been quite right think she wasn't teacher cross. Strict and clever, she gave them talking moment they sat down her first class.
   “Transfiguration is some most complex and dangerous magic you will learn Hogwarts,” she said. “Anyone messing around my class will leave and not come back. You have been warned.”
   Then she changed her desk pig and back again. They were all very impressed and couldn't wait get started, but soon realized they weren't going be changing furniture animals long time. After taking lot complicated notes, they were each given match and started trying turn it needle. By end lesson, only Hermione Granger had made any difference her match; Professor McGonagall showed class how it had gone all silver and pointy and gave Hermione rare smile.
   class everyone had really been looking forward was Defense Against Dark Arts, but Quirrell's lessons turned out be bit joke. His classroom smelled strongly garlic, which everyone said was ward off vampire he'd met Romania and was afraid would be coming back get him one these days. His turban, he told them, had been given him by an African prince thank you getting rid troublesome zombie, but they weren't sure they believed this story. one thing, when Seamus Finnigan asked eagerly hear how Quirrell had fought off zombie, Quirrell went pink and started talking weather; another, they had noticed that funny smell hung around turban, and Weasley twins insisted that it was stuffed full garlic well, so that Quirrell was protected wherever he went.
   Harry was very relieved find out that he wasn't miles behind everyone else. Lots people had come Muggle families and, like him, hadn't had any idea that they were witches and wizards. There was so much learn that even people like Ron didn't have much head start.
   Friday was an important day Harry and Ron. They finally managed find their way down Great Hall breakfast without getting lost once.
   “What have we got today?” Harry asked Ron he poured sugar his porridge.
   “Double Potions Slytherins,” said Ron. “Snape's Head Slytherin House. They say he always favors them—we'll be able see if it's true.”
   “Wish McGonagall favored us,” said Harry. Professor McGonagall was head Gryffindor House, but it hadn't stopped her giving them huge pile homework day before.
   Just then, mail arrived. Harry had gotten used this by now, but it had given him bit shock first morning, when hundred owls had suddenly streamed Great Hall during breakfast, circling tables until they saw their owners, and dropping letters and packages onto their laps.
   Hedwig hadn't brought Harry anything so far. She sometimes flew nibble his ear and have bit toast before going off sleep owlery other school owls. This morning, however, she fluttered down between marmalade and sugar bowl and dropped note onto Harry's plate. Harry tore it open once. It said, very untidy scrawl:
   
    Dear Harry,
    I know you get Friday afternoons off, so would you like come and have cup tea me around three?
    I want hear all your first week. Send us an answer back Hedwig.
    Hagrid
   
   Harry borrowed Ron's quill, scribbled Yes, please, see you later back note, and sent Hedwig off again.
   It was lucky that Harry had tea Hagrid look forward to, because Potions lesson turned out be worst thing that had happened him so far.
   start-of-term banquet, Harry had gotten idea that Professor Snape disliked him. By end first Potions lesson, he knew he'd been wrong. Snape didn't dislike Harry—he hated him.
   Potions lessons took place down one dungeons. It was colder here than up main castle, and would have been quite creepy enough without pickled animals floating glass jars all around walls.
   Snape, like Flitwick, started class by taking roll call, and like Flitwick, he paused Harry's name.
   “Ah, Yes,” he said softly, “Harry Potter. Our new—celebrity.”
   Draco Malfoy and his friends Crabbe and Goyle sniggered behind their hands. Snape finished calling names and looked up class. His eyes were black like Hagrid's, but they had none Hagrid's warmth. They were cold and empty and made you think dark tunnels.
   “You are here learn subtle science and exact art potionmaking,” he began. He spoke barely more than whisper, but they caught every word—like Professor McGonagall, Snape had gift keeping class silent without effort. “As there is little foolish wand waving here, many you will hardly believe this is magic. I don't expect you will really understand beauty softly simmering cauldron its shimmering fumes, delicate power liquids that creep through human veins, bewitching mind, ensnaring senses… I can teach you how bottle fame, brew glory, even stopper death—if you aren't big bunch dunderheads I usually have teach.”
   More silence followed this little speech. Harry and Ron exchanged looks raised eyebrows. Hermione Granger was edge her seat and looked desperate start proving that she wasn't dunderhead.
   “Potter!” said Snape suddenly. “What would I get if I added powdered root asphodel an infusion wormwood?”
   Powdered root what an infusion what? Harry glanced Ron, who looked stumped he was; Hermione's hand had shot air.
   “I don't know, sir,” said Harry.
   Snape's lips curled sneer.
   “Tut, tut—fame clearly isn't everything.”
   He ignored Hermione's hand.
   “Let's try again. Potter, where would you look if I told you find me bezoar?”
   Hermione stretched her hand high air it would go without her leaving her seat, but Harry didn't have faintest idea what bezoar was. He tried not look Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle, who were shaking laughter.
   “I don't know, sir.”
   “Thought you wouldn't open book before coming, eh, Potter?” Harry forced himself keep looking straight those cold eyes. He had looked through his books Dursleys', but did Snape expect him remember everything One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi?
   Snape was still ignoring Hermione's quivering hand.
   “What is difference, Potter, between monkshood and wolfsbane?”
   this, Hermione stood up, her hand stretching toward dungeon ceiling.
   “I don't know,” said Harry quietly. “I think Hermione does, though, why don't you try her?”
   few people laughed; Harry caught Seamus's eye, and Seamus winked. Snape, however, was not pleased.
   “Sit down,” he snapped Hermione. “For your information, Potter, asphodel and wormwood make sleeping potion so powerful it is known Draught Living Death. bezoar is stone taken stomach goat and it will save you most poisons. monkshood and wolfsbane, they are same plant, which also goes by name aconite. Well? Why aren't you all copying that down?”
   There was sudden rummaging quills and parchment. Over noise, Snape said, “And point will be taken Gryffindor House your cheek, Potter.”
   Things didn't improve Gryffindors Potions lesson continued. Snape put them all pairs and set them mixing up simple potion cure boils. He swept around his long black cloak, watching them weigh dried nettles and crush snake fangs, criticizing almost everyone except Malfoy, whom he seemed like. He was just telling everyone look perfect way Malfoy had stewed his horned slugs when clouds acid green smoke and loud hissing filled dungeon. Neville had somehow managed melt Seamus's cauldron twisted blob, and their potion was seeping across stone floor, burning holes people's shoes. Within seconds, whole class was standing their stools while Neville, who had been drenched potion when cauldron collapsed, moaned pain angry red boils sprang up all over his arms and legs.
   “Idiot boy!” snarled Snape, clearing spilled potion away one wave his wand. “I suppose you added porcupine quills before taking cauldron off fire?”
   Neville whimpered boils started pop up all over his nose.
   “Take him up hospital wing,” Snape spat Seamus. Then he rounded Harry and Ron, who had been working next Neville.
   “You—Potter—why didn't you tell him not add quills? Thought he'd make you look good if he got it wrong, did you? That's another point you've lost Gryffindor.”
   This was so unfair that Harry opened his mouth argue, but Ron kicked him behind their cauldron.
   “Don't push it,” he muttered, “I've heard Snape can turn very nasty.”
   they climbed steps out dungeon an hour later, Harry's mind was racing and his spirits were low. He'd lost two points Gryffindor his very first week—why did Snape hate him so much?
   “Cheer up,” said Ron, “Snape's always taking points off Fred and George. Can I come and meet Hagrid you?”
   five three they left castle and made their way across grounds. Hagrid lived small wooden house edge forbidden forest. crossbow and pair galoshes were outside front door.
   When Harry knocked they heard frantic scrabbling inside and several booming barks. Then Hagrid's voice rang out, saying, “Back, Fang—back.”
   Hagrid's big, hairy face appeared crack he pulled door open.
   “Hang on,” he said. “Back, Fang.”
   He let them in, struggling keep hold collar an enormous black boarhound.
   There was only one room inside. Hams and pheasants were hanging ceiling, copper kettle was boiling open fire, and corner stood massive bed patchwork quilt over it.
   “Make yerselves home,” said Hagrid, letting go Fang, who bounded straight Ron and started licking his ears. Like Hagrid, Fang was clearly not fierce he looked.
   “This is Ron,” Harry told Hagrid, who was pouring boiling water large teapot and putting rock cakes onto plate.
   “Another Weasley, eh?” said Hagrid, glancing Ron's freckles. “I spent half me life chasin' yer twin brothers away forest.”
   rock cakes were shapeless lumps raisins that almost broke their teeth, but Harry and Ron pretended be enjoying them they told Hagrid all their first lessons. Fang rested his head Harry's knee and drooled all over his robes.
   Harry and Ron were delighted hear Hagrid call Fitch “that old git.”
   “An' fer that cat, Mrs. Norris, I'd like ter introduce her Fang sometime. D'yeh know, every time I go up ter school, she follows me everywhere? Can't get rid her—Fitch puts her up it.”
   Harry told Hagrid Snape's lesson. Hagrid, like Ron, told Harry not worry it, that Snape liked hardly any students.
   “But he seemed really hate me.”
   “Rubbish!” said Hagrid. “Why should he?”
   Yet Harry couldn't help thinking that Hagrid didn't quite meet his eyes when he said that.
   “How's yer brother Charlie?” Hagrid asked Ron. “I liked him lot—great animals.”
   Harry wondered if Hagrid had changed subject purpose. While Ron told Hagrid all Charlie's work dragons, Harry picked up piece paper that was lying table under tea cozy. It was cutting Daily Prophet:
   
    GRINGOTTS BREAK-IN LATEST
    Investigations continue break Gringotts 31 July, widely believed be work Dark wizards or witches unknown.
    Gringotts goblins today insisted that nothing had been taken. vault that was searched had fact been emptied same day.
    “But we're not telling you what was there, so keep your noses out if you know what's good you,” said Gringotts spokesgoblin this afternoon.
   
   Harry remembered Ron telling him train that someone had tried rob Gringotts, but Ron hadn't mentioned date.
   “Hagrid!” said Harry, “that Gringotts break happened my birthday! It might've been happening while we were there!”
   There was no doubt it, Hagrid definitely didn't meet Harry's eyes this time. He grunted and offered him another rock cake. Harry read story again. vault that was searched had fact been emptied earlier that same day. Hagrid had emptied vault seven hundred and thirteen, if you could call it emptying, taking out that grubby little package. Had that been what thieves were looking for?
   Harry and Ron walked back castle dinner, their pockets weighed down rock cakes they'd been too polite refuse, Harry thought that none lessons he'd had so far had given him much think tea Hagrid. Had Hagrid collected that package just time? Where was it now? And did Hagrid know something Snape that he didn't want tell Harry?
  

  

   

    9. MIDNIGHT DUEL
   

   Harry had never believed he would meet boy he hated more than Dudley, but that was before he met Draco Malfoy. Still, first year Gryffindors only had Potions Slytherins, so they didn't have put up Malfoy much. Or least, they didn't until they spotted notice pinned up Gryffindor common room that made them all groan. Flying lessons would be starting Thursday—and Gryffindor and Slytherin would be learning together.
   “Typical,” said Harry darkly. “Just what I always wanted. make fool myself broomstick front Malfoy.”
   He had been looking forward learning fly more than anything else.
   “You don't know that you'll make fool yourself,” said Ron reasonably. “Anyway, I know Malfoy's always going how good he is Quidditch, but I bet that's all talk.”
   Malfay certainly did talk flying lot. He complained loudly first years never getting house Quidditch teams and told long, boastful stories that always seemed end him narrowly escaping Muggles helicopters. He wasn't only one, though: way Seamus Finnigan told it, he'd spent most his childhood zooming around countryside his broomstick. Even Ron would tell anyone who'd listen time he'd almost hit hang glider Charlie's old broom. Everyone wizarding families talked Quidditch constantly. Ron had already had big argument Dean Thomas, who shared their dormitory, soccer. Ron couldn't see what was exciting game only one ball where no one was allowed fly. Harry had caught Ron prodding Dean's poster West Ham soccer team, trying make players move.
   Neville had never been broomstick his life, because his grandmother had never let him near one. Privately, Harry felt she'd had good reason, because Neville managed have an extraordinary number accidents even both feet ground.
   Hermione Granger was almost nervous flying Neville was. This was something you couldn't learn by heart out book—not that she hadn't tried. breakfast Thursday she bored them all stupid flying tips she'd gotten out library book called Quidditch Through Ages. Neville was hanging her every word, desperate anything that might help him hang his broomstick later, but everybody else was very pleased when Hermione's lecture was interrupted by arrival mail.
   Harry hadn't had single letter since Hagrid's note, something that Malfoy had been quick notice, course. Malfoy's eagle owl was always bringing him packages sweets home, which he opened gloatingly Slytherin table.
   barn owl brought Neville small package his grandmother. He opened it excitedly and showed them glass ball size large marble, which seemed be full white smoke.
   “It's Remembrall!” he explained. “Gran knows I forget things—this tells you if there's something you've forgotten do. Look, you hold it tight like this and if it turns red—oh…” His face fell, because Remembrall had suddenly glowed scarlet, “…you've forgotten something…”
   Neville was trying remember what he'd forgotten when Draco Malfoy, who was passing Gryffindor table, snatched Remembrall out his hand.
   Harry and Ron jumped their feet. They were half hoping reason fight Malfay, but Professor McGonagall, who could spot trouble quicker than any teacher school, was there flash.
   “What's going on?”
   “Malfoy's got my Remembrall, Professor.”
   Scowling, Malfoy quickly dropped Remembrall back table.
   “Just looking,” he said, and he sloped away Crabbe and Goyle behind him.
   three thirty that afternoon, Harry, Ron, and other Gryffindors hurried down front steps onto grounds their first flying lesson. It was clear, breezy day, and grass rippled under their feet they marched down sloping lawns toward smooth, flat lawn opposite side grounds forbidden forest, whose trees were swaying darkly distance.
   Slytherins were already there, and so were twenty broomsticks lying neat lines ground. Harry had heard Fred and George Weasley complain school brooms, saying that some them started vibrate if you flew too high, or always flew slightly left.
   Their teacher, Madam Hooch, arrived. She had short, gray hair, and yellow eyes like hawk.
   “Well, what are you all waiting for?” she barked. “Everyone stand by broomstick. Come on, hurry up.”
   Harry glanced down his broom. It was old and some twigs stuck out odd angles.
   “Stick out your right hand over your broom,” called Madam Hooch front, “and say ‘Up!'”
   “UP!” everyone shouted.
   Harry's broom jumped his hand once, but it was one few that did. Hermione Granger's had simply rolled over ground, and Neville's hadn't moved all. Perhaps brooms, like horses, could tell when you were afraid, thought Harry; there was quaver Neville's voice that said only too clearly that he wanted keep his feet ground.
   Madam Hooch then showed them how mount their brooms without sliding off end, and walked up and down rows correcting their grips. Harry and Ron were delighted when she told Malfoy he'd been doing it wrong years.
   “Now, when I blow my whistle, you kick off ground, hard,” said Madam Hooch. “Keep your brooms steady, rise few feet, and then come straight back down by leaning forward slightly. my whistle—three—two—”
   But Neville, nervous and jumpy and frightened being left ground, pushed off hard before whistle had touched Madam Hooch's lips.
   “Come back, boy!” she shouted, but Neville was rising straight up like cork shot out bottle—twelve feet—twenty feet. Harry saw his scared white face look down ground falling away, saw him gasp, slip sideways off broom and—
   WHAM—a thud and nasty crack and Neville lay facedown grass heap. His broomstick was still rising higher and higher, and started drift lazily toward Forbidden Forest and out sight.
   Madam Hooch was bending over Neville, her face white his.
   “Broken wrist,” Harry heard her mutter. “Come on, boy—it's all right, up you get.”
   She turned rest class.
   “None you is move while I take this boy hospital wing! You leave those brooms where they are or you'll be out Hogwarts before you can say ‘Quidditch.' Come on, dear.”
   Neville, his face tear streaked, clutching his wrist, hobbled off Madam Hooch, who had her arm around him.
   No sooner were they out earshot than Malfoy burst laughter.
   “Did you see his face, great lump?”
   other Slytherins joined in.
   “Shut up, Malfoy,” snapped Parvati Patil.
   “Ooh, sticking up Longbottom?” said Pansy Parkinson, hard faced Slytherin girl. “Never thought you'd like fat little crybabies, Parvati.”
   “Look!” said Malfoy, darting forward and snatching something out grass. “It's that stupid thing Longbottom's gran sent him.”
   Remembrall glittered sun he held it up.
   “Give that here, Malfoy,” said Harry quietly. Everyone stopped talking watch.
   Malfoy smiled nastily.
   “I think I'll leave it somewhere Longbottom find—how about—up tree?”
   “Give it here!” Harry yelled, but Malfoy had leapt onto his broomstick and taken off. He hadn't been lying, he could fly well. Hovering level topmost branches an oak he called, “Come and get it, Potter!”
   Harry grabbed his broom.
   “No!” shouted Hermione Granger. “Madam Hooch told us not move—you'll get us all trouble.”
   Harry ignored her. Blood was pounding his ears. He mounted broom and kicked hard against ground and up, up he soared; air rushed through his hair, and his robes whipped out behind him and rush fierce joy he realized he'd found something he could do without being taught—this was easy, this was wonderful. He pulled his broomstick up little take it even higher, and heard screams and gasps girls back ground and an admiring whoop Ron.
   He turned his broomstick sharply face Malfoy midair. Malfoy looked stunned.
   “Give it here,” Harry called, “or I'll knock you off that broom!”
   “Oh, yeah?” said Malfoy, trying sneer, but looking worried.
   Harry knew, somehow, what do. He leaned forward and grasped broom tightly both hands, and it shot toward Malfay like javelin. Malfoy only just got out way time; Harry made sharp face and held broom steady. few people below were clapping.
   “No Crabbe and Goyle up here save your neck, Malfoy,” Harry called.
   same thought seemed have struck Malfoy.
   “Catch it if you can, then!” he shouted, and he threw glass ball high air and streaked back toward ground.
   Harry saw, though slow motion, ball rise up air and then start fall. He leaned forward and pointed his broom handle down—next second he was gathering speed steep dive, racing ball—wind whistled his ears, mingled screams people watching—he stretched out his hand—a foot ground he caught it, just time pull his broom straight, and he toppled gently onto grass Remembrall clutched safely his fist.
   “HARRY POTTER!”
   His heart sank faster than he'd just dived. Professor McGonagall was running toward them. He got his feet, trembling.
   “Never—in all my time Hogwarts—”
   Professor McGonagall was almost speechless shock, and her glasses flashed furiously, “—how dare you—might have broken your neck—”
   “It wasn't his fault, Professor—”
   “Be quiet, Miss Patil.”
   “But Malfoy—”
   “That's enough, Mr. Weasley. Potter, follow me, now.”
   Harry caught sight Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle's triumphant faces he left, walking numbly Professor McGonagall's wake she strode toward castle. He was going be expelled, he just knew it. He wanted say something defend himself, but there seemed be something wrong his voice. Professor McGonagall was sweeping along without even looking him; he had jog keep up. Now he'd done it. He hadn't even lasted two weeks. He'd be packing his bags ten minutes. What would Dursleys say when he turned up doorstep?
   Up front steps, up marble staircase inside, and still Professor McGonagall didn't say word him. She wrenched open doors and marched along corridors Harry trotting miserably behind her. Maybe she was taking him Dumbledore. He thought Hagrid, expelled but allowed stay gamekeeper. Perhaps he could be Hagrid's assistant. His stomach twisted he imagined it, watching Ron and others becoming wizards, while he stumped around grounds carrying Hagrid's bag.
   Professor McGonagall stopped outside classroom. She opened door and poked her head inside.
   “Excuse me, Professor Flitwick, could I borrow Wood moment?”
   Wood? thought Harry, bewildered; was Wood cane she was going use him?
   But Wood turned out be person, burly fifth year boy who came out Flitwicles class looking confused.
   “Follow me, you two,” said Professor McGonagall, and they marched up corridor, Wood looking curiously Harry.
   “In here.”
   Professor McGonagall pointed them classroom that was empty except Peeves, who was busy writing rude words blackboard.
   “Out, Peeves!” she barked. Peeves threw chalk bin, which clanged loudly, and he swooped out cursing. Professor McGonagall slammed door behind him and turned face two boys.
   “Potter, this is Oliver Wood. Wood—I've found you Seeker.”
   Wood's expression changed puzzlement delight.
   “Are you serious, Professor?”
   “Absolutely,” said Professor McGonagall crisply. “The boy's natural. I've never seen anything like it. Was that your first time broomstick, Potter?”
   Harry nodded silently. He didn't have clue what was going on, but he didn't seem be being expelled, and some feeling started coming back his legs.
   “He caught that thing his hand after fifty foot dive,” Professor McGonagall told Wood. “Didn't even scratch himself. Charlie Weasley couldn't have done it.”
   Wood was now looking though all his dreams had come true once.
   “Ever seen game Quidditch, Potter?” he asked excitedly.
   “Wood's captain Gryffindor team,” Professor McGonagall explained.
   “He's just build Seeker, too,” said Wood, now walking around Harry and staring him. “Light—speedy—we'll have get him decent broom, Professor—a Nimbus Two Thousand or Cleansweep Seven, I'd say.”
   “I shall speak Professor Dumbledore and see if we can't bend first year rule. Heaven knows, we need better team than last year. Flattened that last match by Slytherin, I couldn't look Severus Snape face weeks…”
   Professor McGonagall peered sternly over her glasses Harry.
   “I want hear you're training hard, Potter, or I may change my mind punishing you.”
   Then she suddenly smiled.
   “Your father would have been proud,” she said. “He was an excellent Quidditch player himself.”
   “You're joking.”
   It was dinnertime. Harry had just finished telling Ron what had happened when he'd left grounds Professor McGonagall. Ron had piece steak and kidney pie halfway his mouth, but he'd forgotten all it.
   “Seeker?” he said. “But first years never—you must be youngest house player century, said Harry, shoveling pie his mouth. He felt particularly hungry after excitement afternoon. “Wood told me.”
   Ron was so amazed, so impressed, he just sat and gaped Harry.
   “I start training next week,” said Harry. “Only don't tell anyone, Wood wants keep it secret.”
   Fred and George Weasley now came hall, spotted Harry, and hurried over.
   “Well done,” said George low voice. “Wood told us. We're team too—Beaters.”
   “I tell you, we're going win that Quidditch cup sure this year,” said Fred. “We haven't won since Charlie left, but this year's team is going be brilliant. You must be good, Harry, Wood was almost skipping when he told us.”
   “Anyway, we've got go, Lee Jordan reckons he's found new secret passageway out school.”
   “Bet it's that one behind statue Gregory Smarmy that we found our first week. See you.”
   Fred and George had hardly disappeared when someone far less welcome turned up: Malfoy, flanked by Crabbe and Goyle.
   “Having last meal, Potter? When are you getting train back Muggles?”
   “You're lot braver now that you're back ground and you've got your little friends you,” said Harry coolly. There was course nothing all little Crabbe and Goyle, but High Table was full teachers, neither them could do more than crack their knuckles and scowl.
   “I'd take you anytime my own,” said Malfoy. “Tonight, if you want. Wizard's duel. Wands only—no contact. What's matter? Never heard wizard's duel before, I suppose?”
   “Of course he has,” said Ron, wheeling around. “I'm his second, who's yours?”
   Malfoy looked Crabbe and Goyle, sizing them up.
   “Crabbe,” he said. “Midnight all right? We'll meet you trophy room; that's always unlocked.”
   When Malfoy had gone, Ron and Harry looked each other. “What is wizard's duel?” said Harry. “And what do you mean, you're my second?”
   “Well, second's there take over if you die,” said Ron casually, getting started last his cold pie. Catching look Harry's face, he added quickly, “But people only die proper duels, you know, real wizards. most you and Malfoy'll be able do is send sparks each other. Neither you knows enough magic do any real damage. I bet he expected you refuse, anyway.”
   “And what if I wave my wand and nothing happens?”
   “Throw it away and punch him nose,” Ron suggested.
   “Excuse me.”
   They both looked up. It was Hermione Granger.
   “Can't person eat peace this place?” said Ron.
   Hermione ignored him and spoke Harry.
   “I couldn't help overhearing what you and Malfoy were saying—”
   “Bet you could,” Ron muttered.
   “—and you mustn't go wandering around school night, think points you'll lose Gryffindor if you're caught, and you're bound be. It's really very selfish you.”
   “And it's really none your business,” said Harry.
   “Good-bye,” said Ron.
   All same, it wasn't what you'd call perfect end day, Harry thought, he lay awake much later listening Dean and Seamus falling asleep (Neville wasn't back hospital wing). Ron had spent all evening giving him advice such “If he tries curse you, you'd better dodge it, because I can't remember how block them.” There was very good chance they were going get caught by Filch or Mrs. Norris, and Harry felt he was pushing his luck, breaking another school rule today. other hand, Malfoy's sneering face kept looming up out darkness—this was his big chance beat Malfoy face face. He couldn't miss it.
   “Half past eleven,” Ron muttered last, “we'd better go.”
   They pulled their bathrobes, picked up their wands, and crept across tower room, down spiral staircase, and Gryffindor common room. few embers were still glowing fireplace, turning all armchairs hunched black shadows. They had almost reached portrait hole when voice spoke chair nearest them, “I can't believe you're going do this, Harry.”
   lamp flickered on. It was Hermione Granger, wearing pink bathrobe and frown.
   “You!” said Ron furiously. “Go back bed!”
   “I almost told your brother,” Hermione snapped, “Percy—he's prefect, he'd put stop this.”
   Harry couldn't believe anyone could be so interfering.
   “Come on,” he said Ron. He pushed open portrait Fat Lady and climbed through hole.
   Hermione wasn't going give up that easily. She followed Ron through portrait hole, hissing them like an angry goose.
   “Don't you care Gryffindor, do you only care yourselves, I don't want Slytherin win house cup, and you'll lose all points I got Professor McGonagall knowing Switching Spells.”
   “Go away.”
   “All right, but I warned you, you just remember what I said when you're train home tomorrow, you're so—”
   But what they were, they didn't find out. Hermione had turned portrait Fat Lady get back inside and found herself facing an empty painting. Fat Lady had gone nighttime visit and Hermione was locked out Gryffindor tower.
   “Now what am I going do?” she asked shrilly.
   “That's your problem,” said Ron. “We've got go, we're going be late.”
   They hadn't even reached end corridor when Hermione caught up them.
   “I'm coming you,” she said.
   “You are not.”
   “D'you think I'm going stand out here and wait Filch catch me? If he finds all three us I'll tell him truth, that I was trying stop you, and you can back me up.”
   “You've got some nerve—” said Ron loudly.
   “Shut up, both you!” said Harry sharply. “I heard something.”
   It was sort snuffling.
   “Mrs. Norris?” breathed Ron, squinting through dark.
   It wasn't Mrs. Norris. It was Neville. He was curled up floor, fast asleep, but jerked suddenly awake they crept nearer.
   “Thank goodness you found me! I've been out here hours, I couldn't remember new password get bed.”
   “Keep your voice down, Neville. password's ‘Pig snout' but it won't help you now, Fat Lady's gone off somewhere.”
   “How's your arm?” said Harry.
   “Fine,” said Neville, showing them. “Madam Pomfrey mended it minute.”
   “Good—well, look, Neville, we've got be somewhere, we'll see you later—”
   “Don't leave me!” said Neville, scrambling his feet, “I don't want stay here alone, Bloody Baron's been past twice already.”
   Ron looked his watch and then glared furiously Hermione and Neville.
   “If either you get us caught, I'll never rest until I've learned that Curse Bogies Quirrell told us about, and used it you.”
   Hermione opened her mouth, perhaps tell Ron exactly how use Curse Bogies, but Harry hissed her be quiet and beckoned them all forward.
   They flitted along corridors striped bars moonlight high windows. every turn Harry expected run Filch or Mrs. Norris, but they were lucky. They sped up staircase third floor and tiptoed toward trophy room.
   Malfoy and Crabbe weren't there yet. crystal trophy cases glimmered where moonlight caught them. Cups, shields, plates, and statues winked silver and gold darkness. They edged along walls, keeping their eyes doors either end room. Harry took out his wand case Malfoy leapt and started once. minutes crept by.
   “He's late, maybe he's chickened out,” Ron whispered.
   Then noise next room made them jump. Harry had only just raised his wand when they heard someone speak and it wasn't Malfoy.
   “Sniff around, my sweet, they might be lurking corner.”
   It was Filch speaking Mrs. Norris. Horror struck, Harry waved madly other three follow him quickly possible; they scurried silently toward door, away Filch's voice. Neville's robes had barely whipped round corner when they heard Filch enter trophy room.
   “They're here somewhere,” they heard him mutter, “probably hiding.”
   “This way!” Harry mouthed others and, petrified, they began creep down long gallery full suits armor. They could hear Filch getting nearer. Neville suddenly let out frightened squeak and broke run he tripped, grabbed Ron around waist, and pair them toppled right suit armor.
   clanging and crashing were enough wake whole castle.
   “RUN!” Harry yelled, and four them sprinted down gallery, not looking back see whether Filch was following—they swung around doorpost and galloped down one corridor then another, Harry lead, without any idea where they were or where they were going—they ripped through tapestry and found themselves hidden passageway, hurtled along it and came out near their Charms classroom, which they knew was miles trophy room.
   “I think we've lost him,” Harry panted, leaning against cold wall and wiping his forehead. Neville was bent double, wheezing and spluttering.
   “I—told—you,” Hermione gasped, clutching stitch her chest, “I—told—you.”
   “We've got get back Gryffindor tower,” said Ron, “quickly possible.”
   “Malfoy tricked you,” Hermione said Harry. “You realize that, don't you? He was never going meet you—Filch knew someone was going be trophy room, Malfoy must have tipped him off.”
   Harry thought she was probably right, but he wasn't going tell her that.
   “Let's go.”
   It wasn't going be that simple. They hadn't gone more than dozen paces when doorknob rattled and something came shooting out classroom front them.
   It was Peeves. He caught sight them and gave squeal delight.
   “Shut up, Peeves—please—you'll get us thrown out.”
   Peeves cackled.
   “Wandering around midnight, Ickle Firsties? Tut, tut, tut. Naughty, naughty, you'll get caughty.”
   “Not if you don't give us away, Peeves, please.”
   “Should tell Filch, I should,” said Peeves saintly voice, but his eyes glittered wickedly. “It's your own good, you know.”
   “Get out way,” snapped Ron, taking swipe Peeves this was big mistake.
   “STUDENTS OUT BED!” Peeves bellowed, “STUDENTS OUT BED DOWN CHARMS CORRIDOR—”
   Ducking under Peeves, they ran their lives, right end corridor where they slammed door—and it was locked.
   “This is it!” Ron moaned, they pushed helplessly door, “We're done for! This is end!” They could hear footsteps, Filch running fast he could toward Peeves's shouts.
   “Oh, move over,” Hermione snarled. She grabbed Harry's wand, tapped lock, and whispered, “Alohomora!”
   lock clicked and door swung open—they piled through it, shut it quickly, and pressed their ears against it, listening.
   “Which way did they go, Peeves?” Filch was saying. “Quick, tell me.”
   “Say ‘please.'”
   “Don't mess me, Peeves, now where did they go?”
   “Shan't say nothing if you don't say please,” said Peeves his annoying singsong voice.
   “All right—please.”
   “NOTHING! Ha haaa! Told you I wouldn't say nothing if you didn't say please! Ha ha! Haaaaaa!” And they heard sound Peeves whooshing away and Filch cursing rage.
   “He thinks this door is locked,” Harry whispered. “I think we'll be okay—get off, Neville!” Neville had been tugging sleeve Harry's bathrobe last minute. “What?”
   Harry turned around—and saw, quite clearly, what. moment, he was sure he'd walked nightmare—this was too much, top everything that had happened so far.
   They weren't room, he had supposed. They were corridor. forbidden corridor third floor. And now they knew why it was forbidden.
   They were looking straight eyes monstrous dog, dog that filled whole space between ceiling and floor. It had three heads. Three pairs rolling, mad eyes; three noses, twitching and quivering their direction; three drooling mouths, saliva hanging slippery ropes yellowish fangs.
   It was standing quite still, all six eyes staring them, and Harry knew that only reason they weren't already dead was that their sudden appearance had taken it by surprise, but it was quickly getting over that, there was no mistaking what those thunderous growls meant.
   Harry groped doorknob—between Filch and death, he'd take Filch.
   They fell backward—Harry slammed door shut, and they ran, they almost flew, back down corridor. Filch must have hurried off look them somewhere else, because they didn't see him anywhere, but they hardly cared—all they wanted do was put much space possible between them and that monster. They didn't stop running until they reached portrait Fat Lady seventh floor.
   “Where earth have you all been?” she asked, looking their bathrobes hanging off their shoulders and their flushed, sweaty faces.
   “Never mind that—pig snout, pig snout,” panted Harry, and portrait swung forward. They scrambled common room and collapsed, trembling, armchairs.
   It was while before any them said anything. Neville, indeed, looked if he'd never speak again.
   “What do they think they're doing, keeping thing like that locked up school?” said Ron finally. “If any dog needs exercise, that one does.”
   Hermione had got both her breath and her bad temper back again. “You don't use your eyes, any you, do you?” she snapped. “Didn't you see what it was standing on.”
   “The floor?” Harry suggested. “I wasn't looking its feet, I was too busy its heads.”
   “No, not floor. It was standing trapdoor. It's obviously guarding something.”
   She stood up, glaring them.
   “I hope you're pleased yourselves. We could all have been killed—or worse, expelled. Now, if you don't mind, I'm going bed.”
   Ron stared after her, his mouth open.
   “No, we don't mind,” he said. “You'd think we dragged her along, wouldn't you.”
   But Hermione had given Harry something else think he climbed back bed. dog was guarding something… What had Hagrid said? Gringotts was safest place world something you wanted hide—except perhaps Hogwarts.
   It looked though Harry had found out where grubby littie package vault seven hundred and thirteen was.
  

  

   

    10. HALLOWEEN
   

   Malfoy couldn't believe his eyes when he saw that Harry and Ron were still Hogwarts next day, looking tired but perfectly cheerful. Indeed, by next morning Harry and Ron thought that meeting three headed dog had been an excellent adventure, and they were quite keen have another one. meantime, Harry filled Ron package that seemed have been moved Gringotts Hogwarts, and they spent lot time wondering what could possibly need such heavy protection.
   “It's either really valuable or really dangerous,” said Ron.
   “Or both,” said Harry.
   But all they knew sure mysterious object was that it was two inches long, they didn't have much chance guessing what it was without further clues.
   Neither Neville nor Hermione showed slightest interest what lay underneath dog and trapdoor. All Neville cared was never going near dog again.
   Hermione was now refusing speak Harry and Ron, but she was such bossy know it all that they saw this an added bonus. All they really wanted now was way getting back Malfoy, and their great delight, just such thing arrived mail week later.
   owls flooded Great Hall usual, everyone's attention was caught once by long, thin package carried by six large screech owls. Harry was just interested everyone else see what was this large parcel, and was amazed when owls soared down and dropped it right front him, knocking his bacon floor. They had hardly fluttered out way when another owl dropped letter top parcel.
   Harry ripped open letter first, which was lucky, because it said:
   
    DO NOT OPEN PARCEL TABLE.
    It contains your new Nimbus Two Thousand, but I don't want everybody knowing you've got broomstick or they'll all want one. Oliver Wood will meet you tonight Quidditch field seven o'clock your first training session.
    Professor McGonagall
   
   Harry had difficulty hiding his glee he handed note Ron read.
   “A Nimbus Two Thousand!” Ron moaned enviously. “I've never even touched one.”
   They left hall quickly, wanting unwrap broomstick private before their first class, but halfway across entrance hall they found way upstairs barred by Crabbe and Goyle. Malfoy seized package Harry and felt it.
   “That's broomstick,” he said, throwing it back Harry mixture jealousy and spite his face. “You'll be it this time, Potter, first years aren't allowed them.”
   Ron couldn't resist it.
   “It's not any old broomstick,” he said, “it's Nimbus Two Thousand. What did you say you've got home, Malfoy, Comet Two Sixty?” Ron grinned Harry. “Comets look flashy, but they're not same league Nimbus.”
   “What would you know it, Weasley, you couldn't afford half handle,” Malfoy snapped back. “I suppose you and your brothers have save up twig by twig.”
   Before Ron could answer, Professor Flitwick appeared Malfoy's elbow.
   “Not arguing, I hope, boys?” he squeaked.
   “Potter's been sent broomstick, Professor,” said Malfoy quickly.
   “Yes, yes, that's right,” said Professor Flitwick, beaming Harry. “Professor McGonagall told me all special circumstances, Potter. And what model is it?”
   “A Nimbus Two Thousand, sir,” said Harry, fighting not laugh look horror Malfoy's face. “And it's really thanks Malfoy here that I've got it,” he added.
   Harry and Ron headed upstairs, smothering their laughter Malfoy's obvious rage and confusion. “Well, it's true,” Harry chortled they reached top marble staircase, “If he hadn't stolen Neville's Remembrall I wouln't be team…”
   “So I suppose you think that's reward breaking rules?” came an angry voice just behind them. Hermione was stomping up stairs, looking disapprovingly package Harry's hand.
   “I thought you weren't speaking us?” said Harry.
   “Yes, don't stop now,” said Ron, “it's doing us so much good.”
   Hermione marched away her nose air.
   Harry had lot trouble keeping his mind his lessons that day. It kept wandering up dormitory where his new broomstick was lying under his bed, or straying off Quidditch field where he'd be learning play that night. He bolted his dinner that evening without noticing what he was eating, and then rushed upstairs Ron unwrap Nimbus Two Thousand last.
   “Wow,” Ron sighed, broomstick rolled onto Harry's bedspread.
   Even Harry, who knew nothing different brooms, thought it looked wonderful. Sleek and shiny, mahogany handle, it had long tail neat, straight twigs and Nimbus Two Thousand written gold near top.
   seven o'clock drew nearer, Harry left castle and set off dusk toward Quidditch field. He'd never been inside stadium before. Hundreds seats were raised stands around field so that spectators were high enough see what was going on. either end field were three golden poles hoops end. They reminded Harry little plastic sticks Muggle children blew bubbles through, except that they were fifty feet high.
   Too eager fly again wait Wood, Harry mounted his broomstick and kicked off ground. What feeling—he swooped and out goal posts and then sped up and down field. Nimbus Two Thousand turned wherever he wanted his lightest touch.
   “Hey, Potter, come down!”
   Oliver Wood had arrived. fie was carrying large wooden crate under his arm. Harry landed next him.
   “Very nice,” said Wood, his eyes glinting. “I see what McGonagall meant… you really are natural. I'm just going teach you rules this evening, then you'll be joining team practice three times week.”
   He opened crate. Inside were four different sized balls.
   “Right,” said Wood. “Now, Quidditch is easy enough understand, even if it's not too easy play. There are seven players each side. Three them are called Chasers.”
   “Three Chasers,” Harry repeated, Wood took out bright red ball size soccer ball.
   “This ball's called Quaffle,” said Wood. “The Chasers throw Quaffle each other and try and get it through one hoops score goal. Ten points every time Quaffle goes through one hoops. Follow me?”
   “The Chasers throw Quaffle and put it through hoops score,” Harry recited. “So—that's sort like basketball broomsticks six hoops, isn't it?”
   “What's basketball?” said Wood curiously.
   “Never mind,” said Harry quickly.
   “Now, there's another player each side who's called Keeper. I'm Keeper Gryffindor. I have fly around our hoops and stop other team scoring.”
   “Three Chasers, one Keeper,” said Harry, who was determined remember it all. “And they play Quaffle. Okay, got that. So what are they for?” He pointed three balls left inside box.
   “I'll show you now,” said Wood. “Take this.”
   He handed Harry small club, bit like short baseball bat.
   “I'm going show you what Bludgers do,” Wood said. “These two are Bludgers.”
   He showed Harry two identical balls, jet black and slightly smaller than red Quaffle. Harry noticed that they seemed be straining escape straps holding them inside box.
   “Stand back,” Wood warned Harry. He bent down and freed one Bludgers.
   once, black ball rose high air and then pelted straight Harry's face. Harry swung it bat stop it breaking his nose, and sent it zigzagging away air—it zoomed around their heads and then shot Wood, who dived top it and managed pin it ground.
   “See?” Wood panted, forcing struggling Bludger back crate and strapping it down safely. “The Bludgers rocket around, trying knock players off their brooms. That's why you have two Beaters each team—the Weasley twins are ours—it's their job protect their side Bludgers and try and knock them toward other team. So—think you've got all that?”
   “Three Chasers try and score Quaffle; Keeper guards goal posts; Beaters keep Bludgers away their team,” Harry reeled off.
   “Very good,” said Wood.
   “Er—have Bludgers ever killed anyone?” Harry asked, hoping he sounded offhand.
   “Never Hogwarts. We've had couple broken jaws but nothing worse than that. Now, last member team is Seeker. That's you. And you don't have worry Quaffle or Bludgers—”
   “—unless they crack my head open.”
   “Don't worry, Weasleys are more than match Bludgers—I mean, they're like pair human Bludgers themselves.”
   Wood reached crate and took out fourth and last ball. Compared Quaffle and Bludgers, it was tiny, size large walnut. It was bright gold and had little fluttering silver wings.
   “This,” said Wood, “is Golden Snitch, and it's most important ball lot. It's very hard catch because it's so fast and difficult see. It's Seeker's job catch it. You've got weave and out Chasers, Beaters, Bludgers, and Quaffle get it before other team's Seeker, because whichever Seeker catches Snitch wins his team an extra hundred and fifty points, so they nearly always win. That's why Seekers get fouled so much. game Quidditch only ends when Snitch is caught, so it can go ages—I think record is three months, they had keep bringing substitutes so players could get some sleep.
   “Well, that's it—any questions?”
   Harry shook his head. He understood what he had do all right, it was doing it that was going be problem.
   “We won't practice Snitch yet,” said Wood, carefully shutting it back inside crate, “it's too dark, we might lose it. Let's try you out few these.”
   He pulled bag ordinary golf balls out his pocket and few minutes later, he and Harry were up air, Wood throwing golf balls hard he could every direction Harry catch.
   Harry didn't miss single one, and Wood was delighted. After half an hour, night had really fallen and they couldn't carry on.
   “That Quidditch cup'll have our name it this year,” said Wood happily they trudged back up castle. “I wouldn't be surprised if you turn out better than Charlie Weasley, and he could have played England if he hadn't gone off chasing dragons.”
   Perhaps it was because he was now so busy, what Quidditch practice three evenings week top all his homework, but Harry could hardly believe it when he realized that he'd already been Hogwarts two months. castle felt more like home than Privet Drive ever had. His lessons, too, were becoming more and more interesting now that they had mastered basics.
   Halloween morning they woke delicious smell baking pumpkin wafting through corridors. Even better, Professor Flitwick announced Charms that he thought they were ready start making objects fly, something they had all been dying try since they'd seen him make Neville's toad zoom around classroom. Professor Flitwick put class pairs practice. Harry's partner was Seamus Finnigan (which was relief, because Neville had been trying catch his eye). Ron, however, was be working Hermione Granger. It was hard tell whether Ron or Hermione was angrier this. She hadn't spoken either them since day Harry's broomstick had arrived.
   “Now, don't forget that nice wrist movement we've been practicing!” squeaked Professor Flitwick, perched top his pile books usual. “Swish and flick, remember, swish and flick. And saying magic words properly is very important, too—never forget Wizard Baruffio, who said ‘s' instead ‘f' and found himself floor buffalo his chest.”
   It was very difficult. Harry and Seamus swished and flicked, but feather they were supposed be sending skyward just lay desktop. Seamus got so impatient that he prodded it his wand and set fire it—Harry had put it out his hat.
   Ron, next table, wasn't having much more luck.
   “Wingardium Leviosa!” he shouted, waving his long arms like windmill.
   “You're saying it wrong,” Harry heard Hermione snap. “It's Wing-gar-dium Levi-o-sa, make ‘gar' nice and long.”
   “You do it, then, if you're so clever,” Ron snarled.
   Hermione rolled up sleeves her gown, flicked her wand, and said, “Wingardium Leviosa!”
   Their feather rose off desk and hovered four feet above their heads.
   “Oh, well done!” cried Professor Flitwick, clapping. “Everyone see here, Miss Granger's done it!”
   Ron was very bad mood by end class.
   “It's no wonder no one can stand her,” he said Harry they pushed their way crowded corridor, “she's nightmare, honestly.”
   Someone knocked Harry they hurried past him. It was Hermione. Harry caught glimpse her face—and was startled see that she was tears.
   “I think she heard you.”
   “So?” said Ron, but he looked bit uncomfortable. “She must've noticed she's got no friends.”
   Hermione didn't turn up next class and wasn't seen all afternoon. their way down Great Hall Halloween feast, Harry and Ron overheard Parvati Patil telling her friend Lavender that Hermione was crying girls' bathroom and wanted be left alone. Ron looked still more awkward this, but moment later they had entered Great Hall, where Halloween decorations put Hermione out their minds.
   thousand live bats fluttered walls and ceiling while thousand more swooped over tables low black clouds, making candles pumpkins stutter. feast appeared suddenly golden plates, it had start term banquet.
   Harry was just helping himself baked potato when Professor Quirrell came sprinting hall, his turban askew and terror his face. Everyone stared he reached Professor Dumbledore's chair, slumped against table, and gasped, “Troll—in dungeons—thought you ought know.”
   He then sank floor dead faint.
   There was an uproar. It took several purple firecrackers exploding end Professor Dumbledore's wand bring silence.
   “Prefects,” he rumbled, “lead your Houses back dormitories immediately!”
   Percy was his element.
   “Follow me! Stick together, first years! No need fear troll if you follow my orders! Stay close behind me, now. Make way, first years coming through! Excuse me, I'm prefect!”
   “How could troll get in?” Harry asked they climbed stairs.
   “Don't ask me, they're supposed be really stupid,” said Ron. “Maybe Peeves let it Halloween joke.”
   They passed different groups people hurrying different directions. they jostled their way through crowd confused Hufflepuffs, Harry suddenly grabbed Ron's arm.
   “I've just thought—Hermione.”
   “What her?”
   “She doesn't know troll.”
   Ron bit his lip.
   “Oh, all right,” he snapped. “But Percy'd better not see us.”
   Ducking down, they joined Hufflepuffs going other way, slipped down deserted side corridor, and hurried off toward girls' bathroom. They had just turned corner when they heard quick footsteps behind them.
   “Percy!” hissed Ron, pulling Harry behind large stone griffin.
   Peering around it, however, they saw not Percy but Snape. He crossed corridor and disappeared view.
   “What's he doing?” Harry whispered. “Why isn't he down dungeons rest teachers?”
   “Search me.”
   Quietly possible, they crept along next corridor after Snape's fading footsteps.
   “He's heading third floor,” Harry said, but Ron held up his hand.
   “Can you smell something?”
   Harry sniffed and foul stench reached his nostrils, mixture old socks and kind public toilet no one seems clean.
   And then they heard it—a low grunting, and shuffling footfalls gigantic feet. Ron pointed—at end passage left, something huge was moving toward them. They shrank shadows and watched it emerged patch moonlight.
   It was horrible sight. Twelve feet tall, its skin was dull, granite gray, its great lumpy body like boulder its small bald head perched top like coconut. It had short legs thick tree trunks flat, horny feet. smell coming it was incredible. It was holding huge wooden club, which dragged along floor because its arms were so long.
   troll stopped next doorway and peered inside. It waggled its long ears, making up its tiny mind, then slouched slowly room.
   “The keys lock,” Harry muttered. “We could lock it in.”
   “Good idea,” said Ron nervously.
   They edged toward open door, mouths dry, praying troll wasn't come out it. one great leap, Harry managed grab key, slam door, and lock it.
   “Yes!”
   Flushed their victory, they started run back up passage, but they reached corner they heard something that made their hearts stop—a high, petrified scream—and it was coming chamber they'd just chained up.
   “Oh, no,” said Ron, pale Bloody Baron.
   “It's girls' bathroom!” Harry gasped.
   “Hermione!” they said together.
   It was last thing they wanted do, but what choice did they have? Wheeling around, they sprinted back door and turned key, fumbling their panic. Harry pulled door open and they ran inside.
   Hermione Granger was shrinking against wall opposite, looking if she was faint. troll was advancing her, knocking sinks off walls it went.
   “Confuse it!” Harry said desperately Ron, and, seizing tap, he threw it hard he could against wall.
   troll stopped few feet Hermione. It lumbered around, blinking stupidly, see what had made noise. Its mean little eyes saw Harry. It hesitated, then made him instead, lifting its club it went.
   “Oy, pea brain!” yelled Ron other side chamber, and he threw metal pipe it. troll didn't even seem notice pipe hitting its shoulder, but it heard yell and paused again, turning its ugly snout toward Ron instead, giving Harry time run around it.
   “Come on, run, run!” Harry yelled Hermione, trying pull her toward door, but she couldn't move, she was still flat against wall, her mouth open terror.
   shouting and echoes seemed be driving troll berserk. It roared again and started toward Ron, who was nearest and had no way escape.
   Harry then did something that was both very brave and very stupid: He took great running jump and managed fasten his arms around troll's neck behind. troll couldn't feel Harry hanging there, but even troll will notice if you stick long bit wood up its nose, and Harry's wand had still been his hand when he'd jumped—it had gone straight up one troll's nostrils.
   Howling pain, troll twisted and flailed its club, Harry clinging dear life; any second, troll was going rip him off or catch him terrible blow club.
   Hermione had sunk floor fright; Ron pulled out his own wand—not knowing what he was going do he heard himself cry first spell that came his head: “Wingardium Leviosa!”
   club flew suddenly out troll's hand, rose high, high up air, turned slowly over—and dropped, sickening crack, onto its owner's head. troll swayed spot and then fell flat its face, thud that made whole room tremble.
   Harry got his feet. He was shaking and out breath. Ron was standing there his wand still raised, staring what he had done.
   It was Hermione who spoke first.
   “Is it—dead?”
   “I don't think so,” said Harry, “I think it's just been knocked out.”
   He bent down and pulled his wand out troll's nose. It was covered what looked like lumpy gray glue.
   “Urgh—troll boogers.”
   He wiped it troll's trousers.
   sudden slamming and loud footsteps made three them look up. They hadn't realized what racket they had been making, but course, someone downstairs must have heard crashes and troll's roars. moment later, Professor McGonagall had come bursting room, closely followed by Snape, Quirrell bringing up rear. Quirrell took one look troll, let out faint whimper, and sat quickly down toilet, clutching his heart.
   Snape bent over troll. Professor McGonagall was looking Ron and Harry. Harry had never seen her look so angry. Her lips were white. Hopes winning fifty points Gryffindor faded quickly Harry's mind.
   “What earth were you thinking of?” said Professor McGonagall, cold fury her voice. Harry looked Ron, who was still standing his wand air. “You're lucky you weren't killed. Why aren't you your dormitory?”
   Snape gave Harry swift, piercing look. Harry looked floor. He wished Ron would put his wand down.
   Then small voice came out shadows.
   “Please, Professor McGonagall—they were looking me.”
   “Miss Granger!”
   Hermione had managed get her feet last.
   “I went looking troll because I—I thought I could deal it my own—you know, because I've read all them.”
   Ron dropped his wand. Hermione Granger, telling downright lie teacher?
   “If they hadn't found me, I'd be dead now. Harry stuck his wand up its nose and Ron knocked it out its own club. They didn't have time come and fetch anyone. It was finish me off when they arrived.”
   Harry and Ron tried look though this story wasn't new them.
   “Well—in that case…” said Professor McGonagall, staring three them, “Miss Granger, you foolish girl, how could you think tackling mountain troll your own?”
   Hermione hung her head. Harry was speechless. Hermione was last person do anything against rules, and here she was, pretending she had, get them out trouble. It was if Snape had started handing out sweets.
   “Miss Granger, five points will be taken Gryffindor this,” said Professor McGonagall. “I'm very disappointed you. If you're not hurt all, you'd better get off Gryffindor tower. Students are finishing feast their houses.”
   Hermione left.
   Professor McGonagall turned Harry and Ron.
   “Well, I still say you were lucky, but not many first years could have taken full grown mountain troll. You each win Gryffindor five points. Professor Dumbledore will be informed this. You may go.”
   They hurried out chamber and didn't speak all until they had climbed two floors up. It was relief be away smell troll, quite apart anything else.
   “We should have gotten more than ten points,” Ron grumbled.
   “Five, you mean, once she's taken off Hermione's.”
   “Good her get us out trouble like that,” Ron admitted. “Mind you, we did save her.”
   “She might not have needed saving if we hadn't locked thing her,” Harry reminded him.
   They had reached portrait Fat Lady.
   “Pig snout,” they said and entered.
   common room was packed and noisy. Everyone was eating food that had been sent up. Hermione, however, stood alone by door, waiting them. There was very embarrassed pause. Then, none them looking each other, they all said “Thanks,” and hurried off get plates.
   But that moment on, Hermione Granger became their friend. There are some things you can't share without ending up liking each other, and knocking out twelve-foot mountain troll is one them.
  

  

   

    11. QUIDDITCH
   

   they entered November, weather turned very cold. mountains around school became icy gray and lake like chilled steel. Every morning ground was covered frost. Hagrid could be seen upstairs windows defrosting broomsticks Quidditch field, bundled up long moleskin overcoat, rabbit fur gloves, and enormous beaverskin boots.
   Quidditch season had begun. Saturday, Harry would be playing his first match after weeks training: Gryffindor versus Slytherin. If Gryffindor won, they would move up second place house championship.
   Hardly anyone had seen Harry play because Wood had decided that, their secret weapon, Harry should be kept, well, secret. But news that he was playing Seeker had leaked out somehow, and Harry didn't know which was worse—people telling him he'd be brilliant or people telling him they'd be running around underneath him holding mattress.
   It was really lucky that Harry now had Hermione friend. He didn't know how he'd have gotten through all his homework without her, what all last minute Quidditch practice Wood was making them do. She had also lent him Quidditch Through Ages, which turned out be very interesting read.
   Harry learned that there were seven hundred ways committing Quidditch foul and that all them had happened during World Cup match 1473; that Seekers were usually smallest and fastest players, and that most serious Quidditch accidents seemed happen them; that although people rarely died playing Quidditch, referees had been known vanish and turn up months later Sahara Desert.
   Hermione had become bit more relaxed breaking rules since Harry and Ron had saved her mountain troll, and she was much nicer it. day before Harry's first Quidditch match three them were out freezing courtyard during break, and she had conjured them up bright blue fire that could be carried around jam jar. They were standing their backs it, getting warm, when Snape crossed yard. Harry noticed once that Snape was limping. Harry, Ron, and Hermione moved closer together block fire view; they were sure it wouldn't be allowed. Unfortunately, something their guilty faces caught Snape's eye. He limped over. He hadn't seen fire, but he seemed be looking reason tell them off anyway.
   “What's that you've got there, Potter?”
   It was Quidditch Through Ages. Harry showed him.
   “Library books are not be taken outside school,” said Snape. “Give it me. Five points Gryffindor.”
   “He's just made that rule up,” Harry muttered angrily Snape limped away. “Wonder what's wrong his leg?”
   “Dunno, but I hope it's really hurting him,” said Ron bitterly.
   Gryffindor common room was very noisy that evening. Harry, Ron, and Hermione sat together next window. Hermione was checking Harry and Ron's Charms homework them. She would never let them copy (“How will you learn?”), but by asking her read it through, they got right answers anyway.
   Harry felt restless. He wanted Quidditch Through Ages back, take his mind off his nerves tomorrow. Why should he be afraid Snape? Getting up, he told Ron and Hermione he was going ask Snape if he could have it.
   “Better you than me,” they said together, but Harry had an idea that Snape wouldn't refuse if there were other teachers listening.
   He made his way down staffroom and knocked. There was no answer. He knocked again. Nothing.
   Perhaps Snape had left book there? It was worth try. He pushed door ajar and peered inside—and horrible scene met his eyes.
   Snape and Filch were inside, alone. Snape was holding his robes above his knees. One his legs was bloody and mangled. Filch was handing Snape bandages.
   “Blasted thing,” Snape was saying. “How are you supposed keep your eyes all three heads once?”
   Harry tried shut door quietly, but—
   “POTTER!”
   Snape's face was twisted fury he dropped his robes quickly hide his leg. Harry gulped.
   “I just wondered if I could have my book back.”
   “GET OUT! OUT!”
   Harry left, before Snape could take any more points Gryffindor. He sprinted back upstairs.
   “Did you get it?” Ron asked Harry joined them. “What's matter?”
   low whisper, Harry told them what he'd seen.
   “You know what this means?” he finished breathlessly. “He tried get past that three headed dog Halloween! That's where he was going when we saw him—he's after whatever it's guarding! And I'd bet my broomstick he let that troll in, make diversion!”
   Hermione's eyes were wide.
   “No—he wouldn't, she said. “I know he's not very nice, but he wouldn't try and steal something Dumbledore was keeping safe.”
   “Honestly, Hermione, you think all teachers are saints or something,” snapped Ron. “I'm Harry. I wouldn't put anything past Snape. But what's he after? What's that dog guarding?”
   Harry went bed his head buzzing same question. Neville was snoring loudly, but Harry couldn't sleep. He tried empty his mind—he needed sleep, he had to, he had his first Quidditch match few hours—but expression Snape's face when Harry had seen his leg wasn't easy forget.
   next morning dawned very bright and cold. Great Hall was full delicious smell fried sausages and cheer ful chatter everyone looking forward good Quidditch match.
   “You've got eat some breakfast.”
   “I don't want anything.”
   “Just bit toast,” wheedled Hermione.
   “I'm not hungry.”
   Harry felt terrible. an hour's time he'd be walking onto field.
   “Harry, you need your strength,” said Seamus Finnigan. “Seekers are always ones who get clobbered by other team.”
   “Thanks, Seamus,” said Harry, watching Seamus pile ketchup his sausages.
   By eleven o'clock whole school seemed be out stands around Quidditch pitch. Many students had binoculars. seats might be raised high air, but it was still difficult see what was going sometimes.
   Ron and Hermione joined Neville, Seamus, and Dean West Ham fan up top row. surprise Harry, they had painted large banner one sheets Scabbers had ruined. It said Potter President, and Dean, who was good drawing, had done large Gryffindor lion underneath. Then Hermione had performed tricky little charm so that paint flashed different colors.
   Meanwhile, locker room, Harry and rest team were changing their scarlet Quidditch robes (Slytherin would be playing green).
   Wood cleared his throat silence.
   “Okay, men,” he said.
   “And women,” said Chaser Angelina Johnson.
   “And women,” Wood agreed. “This is it.”
   “The big one,” said Fred Weasley.
   “The one we've all been waiting for,” said George.
   “We know Oliver's speech by heart,” Fred told Harry, “we were team last year.”
   “Shut up, you two,” said Wood. “This is best team Gryffindor's had years. We're going win. I know it.”
   He glared them all if say, “Or else.”
   “Right. It's time. Good luck, all you.”
   Harry followed Fred and George out locker room and, hoping his knees weren't going give way, walked onto field loud cheers.
   Madam Hooch was refereeing. She stood middle field waiting two teams, her broom her hand.
   “Now, I want nice fair game, all you,” she said, once they were all gathered around her. Harry noticed that she seemed be speaking particularly Slytherin Captain, Marcus Flint, sixth year. Harry thought Flint looked if he had some troll blood him. Out corner his eye he saw fluttering banner high above, flashing Potter President over crowd. His heart skipped. He felt braver.
   “Mount your brooms, please.”
   Harry clambered onto his Nimbus Two Thousand.
   Madam Hooch gave loud blast her silver whistle.
   Fifteen brooms rose up, high, high air. They were off.
   “And Quaffle is taken immediately by Angelina Johnson Gryffindor—what an excellent Chaser that girl is, and rather attractive, too—”
   “JORDAN!”
   “Sorry, Professor.”
   Weasley twins' friend, Lee Jordan, was doing commentary match, closely watched by Professor McGonagall.
   “And she's really belting along up there, neat pass Alicia Spinnet, good find Oliver Wood's, last year only reserve—back Johnson and—no, Slytherins have taken Quaffle, Slytherin Captain Marcus Flint gains Quaffle and off he goes—Flint flying like an eagle up there—he's going sc—no, stopped by an excellent move by Gryffindor Keeper Wood and Gryffindors take Quaffle—that's Chaser Katie Bell Gryffindor there, nice dive around Flint, off up field and—OUCH—that must have hurt, hit back head by Bludger—Quaffle taken by Slytherins—that's Adrian Pucey speeding off toward goal posts, but he's blocked by second Bludger—sent his way by Fred or George Weasley, can't tell which—nice play by Gryffindor Beater, anyway, and Johnson back possession Quaffle, clear field ahead and off she goes—she's really flying—dodges speeding Bludger—the goal posts are ahead—come on, now, Angelina—Keeper Bletchley dives—misses—GRYFFINDORS SCORE!”
   Gryffindor cheers filled cold air, howls and moans Slytherins.
   “Budge up there, move along.”
   “Hagrid!”
   Ron and Hermione squeezed together give Hagrid enough space join them.
   “Bin watchin' me hut,” said Hagrid, patting large pair binoculars around his neck, “But it isn't same bein' crowd. No sign Snitch yet, eh?”
   “Nope,” said Ron. “Harry hasn't had much do yet.”
   “Kept outta trouble, though, that's somethin',” said Hagrid, raising his binoculars and peering skyward speck that was Harry.
   Way up above them, Harry was gliding over game, squinting some sign Snitch. This was part his and Wood's game plan.
   “Keep out way until you catch sight Snitch,” Wood had said. “We don't want you attacked before you have be.”
   When Angelina had scored, Harry had done couple loop loops let off his feelings. Now he was back staring around Snitch. Once he caught sight flash gold, but it was just reflection one Weasleys' wristwatches, and once Bludger decided come pelting his way, more like cannonball than anything, but Harry dodged it and Fred Weasley came chasing after it.
   “All right there, Harry?” he had time yell, he beat Bludger furiously toward Marcus Flint.
   “Slytherin possession,” Lee Jordan was saying, “Chaser Pucey ducks two Bludgers, two Weasleys, and Chaser Bell, and speeds toward the—wait moment—was that Snitch?”
   murmur ran through crowd Adrian Pucey dropped Quaffle, too busy looking over his shoulder flash gold that had passed his left ear.
   Harry saw it. great rush excitement he dived downward after streak gold. Slytherin Seeker Terence Higgs had seen it, too. Neck and neck they hurtled toward Snitch all Chasers seemed have forgotten what they were supposed be doing they hung midair watch.
   Harry was faster than Higgs—he could see little round ball, wings fluttering, darting up ahead—he put an extra spurt speed—
   WHAM! roar rage echoed Gryffindors below—Marcus Flint had blocked Harry purpose, and Harry's broom spun off course, Harry holding dear life.
   “Foul!” screamed Gryffindors.
   Madam Hooch spoke angrily Flint and then ordered free shot goal posts Gryffindor. But all confusion, course, Golden Snitch had disappeared sight again.
   Down stands, Dean Thomas was yelling, “Send him off, ref! Red card!”
   “What are you talking about, Dean?” said Ron.
   “Red card!” said Dean furiously. “In soccer you get shown red card and you're out game!”
   “But this isn't soccer, Dean,” Ron reminded him.
   Hagrid, however, was Dean's side.
   “They oughta change rules. Flint coulda knocked Harry outta air.”
   Lee Jordan was finding it difficult not take sides.
   “So—after that obvious and disgusting bit cheating—”
   “Jordan!” growled Professor McGonagall.
   “I mean, after that open and revolting foul—”
   “Jordan, I'm warning you—”
   “All right, all right. Flint nearly kills Gryffindor Seeker, which could happen anyone, I'm sure, so penalty Gryffindor, taken by Spinner, who puts it away, no trouble, and we continue play, Gryffindor still possession.”
   It was Harry dodged another Bludger, which went spinning dangerously past his head, that it happened. His broom gave sudden, frightening lurch. split second, he thought he was going fall. He gripped broom tightly both his hands and knees. He'd never felt anything like that.
   It happened again. It was though broom was trying buck him off. But Nimbus Two Thousands did not suddenly decide buck their riders off. Harry tried turn back toward Gryffindor goal-posts—he had half mind ask Wood call time out—and then he realized that his broom was completely out his control. He couldn't turn it. He couldn't direct it all. It was zigzagging through air, and every now and then making violent swishing movements that almost unseated him.
   Lee was still commentating.
   “Slytherin possession—Flint Quaffle—passes Spinnet—passes Bell—hit hard face by Bludger, hope it broke his nose—only joking, Professor—Slytherins score—A no…”
   Slytherins were cheering. No one seemed have noticed that Harry's broom was behaving strangely. It was carrying him slowly higher, away game, jerking and twitching it went.
   “Dunno what Harry thinks he's doing,” Hagrid mumbled. He stared through his binoculars. “If I didn' know better, I'd say he'd lost control his broom… but he can't have…”
   Suddenly, people were pointing up Harry all over stands. His broom had started roll over and over, him only just managing hold on. Then whole crowd gasped. Harry's broom had given wild jerk and Harry swung off it. He was now dangling it, holding only one hand.
   “Did something happen it when Flint blocked him?” Seamus whispered.
   “Can't have,” Hagrid said, his voice shaking. “Can't nothing interfere broomstick except powerful Dark magic—no kid could do that Nimbus Two Thousand.”
   these words, Hermione seized Hagrid's binoculars, but instead looking up Harry, she started looking frantically crowd.
   “What are you doing?” moaned Ron, gray faced.
   “I knew it,” Hermione gasped, “Snape—look.”
   Ron grabbed binoculars. Snape was middle stands opposite them. He had his eyes fixed Harry and was muttering nonstop under his breath.
   “He's doing something—jinxing broom,” said Hermione.
   “What should we do?”
   “Leave it me.”
   Before Ron could say another word, Hermione had disappeared. Ron turned binoculars back Harry. His broom was vibrating so hard, it was almost impossible him hang much longer. whole crowd was its feet, watching, terrified, Weasleys flew up try and pull Harry safely onto one their brooms, but it was no good—every time they got near him, broom would jump higher still. They dropped lower and circled beneath him, obviously hoping catch him if he fell. Marcus Flint seized Quaffle and scored five times without anyone noticing.
   “Come on, Hermione,” Ron muttered desperately.
   Hermione had fought her way across stand where Snape stood, and was now racing along row behind him; she didn't even stop say sorry she knocked Professor Quirrell headfirst row front. Reaching Snape, she crouched down, pulled out her wand, and whispered few, well-chosen words. Bright blue flames shot her wand onto hem Snape's robes.
   It took perhaps thirty seconds Snape realize that he was fire. sudden yelp told her she had done her job. Scooping fire off him little jar her pocket, she scrambled back along row—Snape would never know what had happened.
   It was enough. Up air, Harry was suddenly able clamber back his broom.
   “Neville, you can look!” Ron said. Neville had been sobbing Hagrid's jacket last five minutes.
   Harry was speeding toward ground when crowd saw him clap his hand his mouth though he was be sick—he hit field all fours—coughed—and something gold fell his hand.
   “I've got Snitch!” he shouted, waving it above his head, and game ended complete confusion.
   “He didn't catch it, he nearly swallowed it,” Flint was still howling twenty minutes later, but it made no difference—Harry hadn't broken any rules and Lee Jordan was still happily shouting results—Gryffindor had won by one hundred and seventy points sixty. Harry heard none this, though. He was being made cup strong tea back Hagrid's hut, Ron and Hermione.
   “It was Snape,” Ron was explaining, “Hermione and I saw him. He was cursing your broomstick, muttering, he wouldn't take his eyes off you.”
   “Rubbish,” said Hagrid, who hadn't heard word what had gone next him stands. “Why would Snape do somethin' like that?”
   Harry, Ron, and Hermione looked one another, wondering what tell him. Harry decided truth.
   “I found out something him,” he told Hagrid. “He tried get past that three headed dog Halloween. It bit him. We think he was trying steal whatever it's guarding.”
   Hagrid dropped teapot.
   “How do you know Fluffy?” he said.
   “Fluffy?”
   “Yeah—he's mine—bought him off Greek chappie I met pub las' year—I lent him Dumbledore guard the—”
   “Yes?” said Harry eagerly.
   “Now, don't ask me anymore,” said Hagrid gruffly. “That's top secret, that is.”
   “But Snape's trying steal it.”
   “Rubbish,” said Hagrid again. “Snape's Hogwarts teacher, he'd do nothin' sort.”
   “So why did he just try and kill Harry?” cried Hermione.
   afternoon's events certainly seemed have changed her mind Snape.
   “I know jinx when I see one, Hagrid, I've read all them! You've got keep eye contact, and Snape wasn't blinking all, I saw him!”
   “I'm tellin' yeh, yer wrong!” said Hagrid hotly. “I don' know why Harry's broom acted like that, but Snape wouldn' try an' kill student! Now, listen me, all three yeh—yer meddlin' things that don' concern yeh. It's dangerous. You forget that dog, an' you forget what it's guardin', that's between Professor Dumbledore an' Nicolas Flamel—”
   “Aha!” said Harry, “so there's someone called Nicolas Flamel involved, is there?”
   Hagrid looked furious himself.
  

  

   

    12. MIRROR ERISED
   

   Christmas was coming. One morning mid December, Hogwarts woke find itself covered several feet snow. lake froze solid and Weasley twins were punished bewitching several snowballs so that they followed Quirrell around, bouncing off back his turban. few owls that managed battle their way through stormy sky deliver mail had be nursed back health by Hagrid before they could fly off again.
   No one could wait holidays start. While Gryffindor common room and Great Hall had roaring fires, drafty corridors had become icy and bitter wind rattled windows classrooms. Worst all were Professor Snape's classes down dungeons, where their breath rose mist before them and they kept close possible their hot cauldrons.
   “I do feel so sorry,” said Draco Malfoy, one Potions class, “for all those people who have stay Hogwarts Christmas because they're not wanted home.”
   He was looking over Harry he spoke. Crabbe and Goyle chuckled. Harry, who was measuring out powdered spine lionfish, ignored them. Malfoy had been even more unpleasant than usual since Quidditch match. Disgusted that Slytherins had lost, he had tried get everyone laughing how wide mouthed tree frog would be replacing Harry Seeker next. Then he'd realized that nobody found this funny, because they were all so impressed way Harry had managed stay his bucking broomstick. So Malfoy, jealous and angry, had gone back taunting Harry having no proper family.
   It was true that Harry wasn't going back Privet Drive Christmas. Professor McGonagall had come around week before, making list students who would be staying holidays, and Harry had signed up once. He didn't feel sorry himself all; this would probably be best Christmas he'd ever had. Ron and his brothers were staying, too, because Mr. and Mrs. Weasley were going Romania visit Charlie.
   When they left dungeons end Potions, they found large fir tree blocking corridor ahead. Two enormous feet sticking out bottom and loud puffing sound told them that Hagrid was behind it.
   “Hi, Hagrid, want any help?” Ron asked, sticking his head through branches.
   “Nah, I'm all right, thanks, Ron.”
   “Would you mind moving out way?” came Malfoy's cold drawl behind them. “Are you trying earn some extra money, Weasley? Hoping be gamekeeper yourself when you leave Hogwarts, I suppose—that hut Hagrid's must seem like palace compared what your family's used to.”
   Ron dived Malfoy just Snape came up stairs.
   “WEASLEY!”
   Ron let go front Malfoy's robes.
   “He was provoked, Professor Snape,” said Hagrid, sticking his huge hairy face out behind tree. “Malfoy was insultin' his family.”
   “Be that it may, fighting is against Hogwarts rules, Hagrid,” said Snape silkily. “Five points Gryffindor, Weasley, and be grateful it isn't more. Move along, all you.”
   Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle pushed roughly past tree, scattering needles everywhere and smirking.
   “I'll get him,” said Ron, grinding his teeth Malfoy's back, “one these days, I'll get him—”
   “I hate them both,” said Harry, “Malfoy and Snape.”
   “Come on, cheer up, it's nearly Christmas,” said Hagrid. “Tell yeh what, come me an' see Great Hall, looks treat.”
   So three them followed Hagrid and his tree off Great Hall, where Professor McGonagall and Professor Flitwick were busy Christmas decorations.
   “Ah, Hagrid, last tree—put it far corner, would you?”
   hall looked spectacular. Festoons holly and mistletoe hung all around walls, and no less than twelve towering Christmas trees stood around room, some sparkling tiny icicles, some glittering hundreds candles.
   “How many days you got left until yer holidays?” Hagrid asked.
   “Just one,” said Hermione. “And that reminds me—Harry, Ron, we've got half an hour before lunch, we should be library.”
   “Oh yeah, you're right,” said Ron, tearing his eyes away Professor Flitwick, who had golden bubbles blossoming out his wand and was trailing them over branches new tree.
   “The library?” said Hagrid, following them out hall. “Just before holidays? Bit keen, aren't yeh?”
   “Oh, we're not working,” Harry told him brightly. “Ever since you mentioned Nicolas Flamel we've been trying find out who he is.”
   “You what?” Hagrid looked shocked. “Listen here—I've told yeh—drop it. It's nothin' you what that dog's guardin'.”
   “We just want know who Nicolas Flamel is, that's all,” said Hermione.
   “Unless you'd like tell us and save us trouble?” Harry added. “We must've been through hundreds books already and we can't find him anywhere—just give us hint—I know I've read his name somewhere.”
   “I'm sayin' nothin',” said Hagrid flatly.
   “Just have find out ourselves, then,” said Ron, and they left Hagrid looking disgruntled and hurried off library.
   They had indeed been searching books Flamel's name ever since Hagrid had let it slip, because how else were they going find out what Snape was trying steal? trouble was, it was very hard know where begin, not knowing what Flamel might have done get himself book. He wasn't Great Wizards Twentieth Century, or Notable Magical Names Our Time; he was missing, too, Important Modern Magical Discoveries, and Study Recent Developments Wizardry. And then, course, there was sheer size library; tens thousands books; thousands shelves; hundreds narrow rows.
   Hermione took out list subjects and titles she had decided search while Ron strode off down row books and started pulling them off shelves random. Harry wandered over Restricted Section. He had been wondering while if Flamel wasn't somewhere there. Unfortunately, you needed specially signed note one teachers look any restricted books, and he knew he'd never get one. These were books containing powerful Dark Magic never taught Hogwarts, and only read by older students studying advanced Defense Against Dark Arts.
   “What are you looking for, boy?”
   “Nothing,” said Harry.
   Madam Pince librarian brandished feather duster him.
   “You'd better get out, then. Go on—out!”
   Wishing he'd been bit quicker thinking up some story, Harry left library. He, Ron, and Hermione had already agreed they'd better not ask Madam Pince where they could find Flamel. They were sure she'd be able tell them, but they couldn't risk Snape hearing what they were up to.
   Harry waited outside corridor see if other two had found anything, but he wasn't very hopeful. They had been looking two weeks, after A, but they only had odd moments between lessons it wasn't surprising they'd found nothing. What they really needed was nice long search without Madam Pince breathing down their necks.
   Five minutes later, Ron and Hermione joined him, shaking their heads. They went off lunch.
   “You will keep looking while I'm away, won't you?” said Hermione. “And send me an owl if you find anything.”
   “And you could ask your parents if they know who Flamel is,” said Ron. “It'd be safe ask them.”
   “Very safe, they're both dentists,” said Hermione.
   Once holidays had started, Ron and Harry were having too good time think much Flamel. They had dormitory themselves and common room was far emptier than usual, so they were able get good armchairs by fire. They sat by hour eating anything they could spear toasting fork—bread, English muffins, marshmallows—and plotting ways getting Malfoy expelled, which were fun talk even if they wouldn't work.
   Ron also started teaching Harry wizard chess. This was exactly like Muggle chess except that figures were alive, which made it lot like directing troops battle. Ron's set was very old and battered. Like everything else he owned, it had once belonged someone else his family—in this case, his grandfather. However, old chessmen weren't drawback all. Ron knew them so well he never had trouble getting them do what he wanted.
   Harry played chessmen Seamus Finnigan had lent him, and they didn't trust him all. He wasn't very good player yet and they kept shouting different bits advice him, which was confusing. “Don't send me there, can't you see his knight? Send him, we can afford lose him.”
   Christmas Eve, Harry went bed looking forward next day food and fun, but not expecting any presents all. When he woke early morning, however, first thing he saw was small pile packages foot his bed.
   “Merry Christmas,” said Ron sleepily Harry scrambled out bed and pulled his bathrobe.
   “You, too,” said Harry. “Will you look this? I've got some presents!”
   “What did you expect, turnips?” said Ron, turning his own pile, which was lot bigger than Harry's.
   Harry picked up top parcel. It was wrapped thick brown paper and scrawled across it was Harry, Hagrid. Inside was roughly cut wooden flute. Hagrid had obviously whittled it himself. Harry blew it—it sounded bit like an owl.
   second, very small parcel contained note.
   
    We received your message and enclose your Christmas present. Uncle Vernon and Aunt Petunia.
   
   Taped note was fifty pence piece.
   “That's friendly,” said Harry.
   Ron was fascinated by fifty pence.
   “Weird!” he said, “What shape! This is money?”
   “You can keep it,” said Harry, laughing how pleased Ron was. “Hagrid and my aunt and uncle—so who sent these?”
   “I think I know who that one's from,” said Ron, turning bit pink and pointing very lumpy parcel. “My mom. I told her you didn't expect any presents and—oh, no,” he groaned, “she's made you Weasley sweater.”
   Harry had torn open parcel find thick, hand knitted sweater emerald green and large box homemade fudge.
   “Every year she makes us sweater,” said Ron, unwrapping his own, “and mine's always maroon.”
   “That's really nice her,” said Harry, trying fudge, which was very tasty.
   His next present also contained candy—a large box Chocolate Frogs Hermione.
   This only left one parcel. Harry picked it up and felt it. It was very light. He unwrapped it.
   Something fluid and silvery gray went slithering floor where it lay gleaming folds. Ron gasped.
   “I've heard those,” he said hushed voice, dropping box Every Flavor Beans he'd gotten Hermione. “If that's what I think it is—they're really rare, and really valuable.”
   “What is it?”
   Harry picked shining, silvery cloth off floor. It was strange touch, like water woven material.
   “It's an Invisibility Cloak,” said Ron, look awe his face. “I'm sure it is—try it on.”
   Harry threw cloak around his shoulders and Ron gave yell.
   “It is! Look down!”
   Harry looked down his feet, but they were gone. He dashed mirror. Sure enough, his reflection looked back him, just his head suspended midair, his body completely invisible. He pulled cloak over his head and his reflection vanished completely.
   “There's note!” said Ron suddenly. “A note fell out it!”
   Harry pulled off cloak and seized letter. Written narrow, loopy writing he had never seen before were following words:
   
    Your father left this my possession before he died.
    It is time it was returned you.
    Use it well.
    Very Merry Christmas you.
   
   There was no signature. Harry stared note. Ron was admiring cloak.
   “I'd give anything one these,” he said. “Anything. What's matter?”
   “Nothing,” said Harry. He felt very strange. Who had sent cloak? Had it really once belonged his father?
   Before he could say or think anything else, dormitory door was flung open and Fred and George Weasley bounded in. Harry stuffed cloak quickly out sight. He didn't feel like sharing it anyone else yet.
   “Merry Christmas!”
   “Hey, look—Harry's got Weasley sweater, too!”
   Fred and George were wearing blue sweaters, one large yellow F it, other G.
   “Harry's is better than ours, though,” said Fred, holding up Harry's sweater. “She obviously makes more an effort if you're not family.”
   “Why aren't you wearing yours, Ron?” George demanded. “Come on, get it on, they're lovely and warm.”
   “I hate maroon,” Ron moaned halfheartedly he pulled it over his head.
   “You haven't got letter yours,” George observed. “I suppose she thinks you don't forget your name. But we're not stupid—we know we're called Gred and Forge.”
   “What's all this noise.”
   Percy Weasley stuck his head through door, looking disapproving. He had clearly gotten halfway through unwrapping his presents he, too, carried lumpy sweater over his arm, which Fred seized.
   “P prefect! Get it on, Percy, come on, we're all wearing ours, even Harry got one.”
   “I—don't—want,” said Percy thickly, twins forced sweater over his head, knocking his glasses askew.
   “And you're not sitting prefects today, either,” said George. “Christmas is time family.”
   They frog-marched Percy room, his arms pinned his side by his sweater.
   Harry had never all his life had such Christmas dinner. hundred fat, roast turkeys; mountains roast and boiled potatoes; platters chipolatas; tureens buttered peas, silver boats thick, rich gravy and cranberry sauce—and stacks wizard crackers every few feet along table. These fantastic party favors were nothing like feeble Muggle ones Dursleys usually bought, their little plastic toys and their flimsy paper hats inside. Harry pulled wizard cracker Fred and it didn't just bang, it went off blast like cannon and engulfed them all cloud blue smoke, while inside exploded rear admiral's hat and several live, white mice. Up High Table, Dumbledore had swapped his pointed wizard's hat flowered bonnet, and was chuckling merrily joke Professor Flitwick had just read him.
   Flaming Christmas puddings followed turkey. Percy nearly broke his teeth silver sickle embedded his slice. Harry watched Hagrid getting redder and redder face he called more wine, finally kissing Professor McGonagall cheek, who, Harry's amazement, giggled and blushed, her top hat lopsided.
   When Harry finally left table, he was laden down stack things out crackers, including pack nonexplodable, luminous balloons, Grow-Your-Own-Warts kit, and his own new wizard chess set. white mice had disappeared and Harry had nasty feeling they were going end up Mrs. Norris's Christmas dinner.
   Harry and Weasleys spent happy afternoon having furious snowball fight grounds. Then, cold, wet, and gasping breath, they returned fire Gryffindor common room, where Harry broke his new chess set by losing spectacularly Ron. He suspected he wouldn't have lost so badly if Percy hadn't tried help him so much.
   After meal turkey sandwiches, crumpets, trifle, and Christmas cake, everyone felt too full and sleepy do much before bed except sit and watch Percy chase Fred and George all over Gryffindor tower because they'd stolen his prefect badge.
   It had been Harry's best Christmas day ever. Yet something had been nagging back his mind all day. Not until he climbed bed was he free think it: Invisibility Cloak and whoever had sent it.
   Ron, full turkey and cake and nothing mysterious bother him, fell asleep almost soon he'd drawn curtains his four poster. Harry leaned over side his own bed and pulled cloak out under it.
   His father's… this had been his father's. He let material flow over his hands, smoother than silk, light air. Use it well, note had said.
   He had try it, now. He slipped out bed and wrapped cloak around himself. Looking down his legs, he saw only moonlight and shadows. It was very funny feeling.
   Use it well.
   Suddenly, Harry felt wide-awake. whole Hogwarts was open him this cloak. Excitement flooded through him he stood there dark and silence. He could go anywhere this, anywhere, and Filch would never know.
   Ron grunted his sleep. Should Harry wake him? Something held him back—his father's cloak—he felt that this time—the first time—he wanted use it alone.
   He crept out dormitory, down stairs, across common room, and climbed through portrait hole.
   “Who's there?” squawked Fat Lady. Harry said nothing. He walked quickly down corridor.
   Where should he go? He stopped, his heart racing, and thought. And then it came him. Restricted Section library. He'd be able read long he liked, long it took find out who Flamel was. He set off, drawing Invisibility Cloak tight around him he walked.
   library was pitch black and very eerie. Harry lit lamp see his way along rows books. lamp looked if it was floating along midair, and even though Harry could feel his arm supporting it, sight gave him creeps.
   Restricted Section was right back library. Stepping carefully over rope that separated these books rest library, he held up his lamp read titles.
   They didn't tell him much. Their peeling, faded gold letters spelled words languages Harry couldn't understand. Some had no title all. One book had dark stain it that looked horribly like blood. hairs back Harry's neck prickled. Maybe he was imagining it, maybe not, but he thought faint whispering was coming books, though they knew someone was there who shouldn't be.
   He had start somewhere. Setting lamp down carefully floor, he looked along bottom shelf an interestinglooking book. large black and silver volume caught his eye. He pulled it out difficulty, because it was very heavy, and, balancing it his knee, let it fall open.
   piercing, bloodcurdling shriek split silence—the book was screaming! Harry snapped it shut, but shriek went and on, one high, unbroken, earsplitting note. He stumbled backward and knocked over his lamp, which went out once. Panicking, he heard footsteps coming down corridor outside—stuffing shrieking book back shelf, he ran it. He passed Filch doorway; Filch's pale, wild eyes looked straight through him, and Harry slipped under Filch's outstretched arm and streaked off up corridor, book's shrieks still ringing his ears.
   He came sudden halt front tall suit armor. He had been so busy getting away library, he hadn't paid attention where he was going. Perhaps because it was dark, he didn't recognize where he was all. There was suit armor near kitchens, he knew, but he must be five floors above there.
   “You asked me come directly you, Professor, if anyone was wandering around night, and somebody's been library Restricted Section.”
   Harry felt blood drain out his face. Wherever he was, Filch must know shortcut, because his soft, greasy voice was getting nearer, and his horror, it was Snape who replied, “The Restricted Section? Well, they can't be far, we'll catch them.”
   Harry stood rooted spot Filch and Snape came around corner ahead. They couldn't see him, course, but it was narrow corridor and if they came much nearer they'd knock right him—the cloak didn't stop him being solid.
   He backed away quietly he could. door stood ajar his left. It was his only hope. He squeezed through it, holding his breath, trying not move it, and his relief he managed get inside room without their noticing anything. They walked straight past, and Harry leaned against wall, breathing deeply, listening their footsteps dying away. That had been close, very close. It was few seconds before he noticed anything room he had hidden in.
   It looked like an unused classroom. dark shapes desks and chairs were piled against walls, and there was an upturned wastepaper basket—but propped against wall facing him was something that didn't look if it belonged there, something that looked if someone had just put it there keep it out way.
   It was magnificent mirror, high ceiling, an ornate gold frame, standing two clawed feet. There was an inscription carved around top: Erised stra ehru oyt ube cafru oyt wohsi. His panic fading now that there was no sound Filch and Snape, Harry moved nearer mirror, wanting look himself but see no reflection again. He stepped front it.
   He had clap his hands his mouth stop himself screaming. He whirled around. His heart was pounding far more furiously than when book had screamed—for he had seen not only himself mirror, but whole crowd people standing right behind him. But room was empty. Breathing very fast, he turned slowly back mirror.
   There he was, reflected it, white and scared looking, and there, reflected behind him, were least ten others. Harry looked over his shoulder—but still, no one was there. Or were they all invisible, too? Was he fact room full invisible people and this mirror's trick was that it reflected them, invisible or not?
   He looked mirror again. woman standing right behind his reflection was smiling him and waving. He reached out hand and felt air behind him. If she was really there, he'd touch her, their reflections were so close together, but he felt only air—she and others existed only mirror.
   She was very pretty woman. She had dark red hair and her eyes—her eyes are just like mine, Harry thought, edging little closer glass. Bright green—exactly same shape, but then he noticed that she was crying; smiling, but crying same time. tall, thin, black haired man standing next her put his arm around her. He wore glasses, and his hair was very untidy. It stuck up back, just Harry's did.
   Harry was so close mirror now that his nose was nearly touching that his reflection.
   “Mom?” he whispered. “Dad?”
   They just looked him, smiling. And slowly, Harry looked faces other people mirror, and saw other pairs green eyes like his, other noses like his, even little old man who looked though he had Harry's knobbly knees—Harry was looking his family, first time his life.
   Potters smiled and waved Harry and he stared hungrily back them, his hands pressed flat against glass though he was hoping fall right through it and reach them. He had powerful kind ache inside him, half joy, half terrible sadness.
   How long he stood there, he didn't know. reflections did not fade and he looked and looked until distant noise brought him back his senses. He couldn't stay here, he had find his way back bed. He tore his eyes away his mother's face, whispered, “I'll come back,” and hurried room.
   “You could have woken me up,” said Ron, crossly.
   “You can come tonight, I'm going back, I want show you mirror.”
   “I'd like see your mom and dad,” Ron said eagerly.
   “And I want see all your family, all Weasleys, you'll be able show me your other brothers and everyone.”
   “You can see them any old time,” said Ron. “Just come round my house this summer. Anyway, maybe it only shows dead people. Shame not finding Flamel, though. Have some bacon or something, why aren't you eating anything?”
   Harry couldn't eat. He had seen his parents and would be seeing them again tonight. He had almost forgotten Flamel. It didn't seem very important anymore. Who cared what three headed dog was guarding? What did it matter if Snape stole it, really?
   “Are you all right?” said Ron. “You look odd.”
   What Harry feared most was that he might not be able find mirror room again. Ron covered cloak, too, they had walk much more slowly next night. They tried retracing Harry's route library, wandering around dark passageways nearly an hour.
   “I'm freezing,” said Ron. “Let's forget it and go back.”
   “No!” Harry hissed. I know it's here somewhere.”
   They passed ghost tall witch gliding opposite direction, but saw no one else. Just Ron started moaning that his feet were dead cold, Harry spotted suit armor.
   “It's here—just here—yes!”
   They pushed door open. Harry dropped cloak around his shoulders and ran mirror.
   There they were. His mother and father beamed sight him.
   “See?” Harry whispered.
   “I can't see anything.”
   “Look! Look them all… there are loads them…”
   “I can only see you.”
   “Look it properly, go on, stand where I am.”
   Harry stepped aside, but Ron front mirror, he couldn't see his family anymore, just Ron his paisley pajamas.
   Ron, though, was staring transfixed his image.
   “Look me!” he said.
   “Can you see all your family standing around you?”
   “No—I'm alone—but I'm different—I look older—and I'm head boy!”
   “What?”
   “I am—I'm wearing badge like Bill used to—and I'm holding house cup and Quidditch cup—I'm Quidditch captain, too.”
   Ron tore his eyes away this splendid sight look excitedly Harry.
   “Do you think this mirror shows future?”
   “How can it? All my family are dead—let me have another look—”
   “You had it yourself all last night, give me bit more time.”
   “You're only holding Quidditch cup, what's interesting that? I want see my parents.”
   “Don't push me—”
   sudden noise outside corridor put an end their discussion. They hadn't realized how loudly they had been talking.
   “Quick!”
   Ron threw cloak back over them luminous eyes Mrs. Norris came round door. Ron and Harry stood quite still, both thinking same thing—did cloak work cats? After what seemed an age, she turned and left.
   “This isn't safe—she might have gone Filch, I bet she heard us. Come on.”
   And Ron pulled Harry out room.
   snow still hadn't melted next morning.
   “Want play chess, Harry?” said Ron.
   “No.”
   “Why don't we go down and visit Hagrid?”
   “No… you go…”
   “I know what you're thinking about, Harry, that mirror. Don't go back tonight.”
   “Why not?”
   “I dunno, I've just got bad feeling it—and anyway, you've had too many close shaves already. Filch, Snape, and Mrs. Norris are wandering around. So what if they can't see you? What if they walk you? What if you knock something over?”
   “You sound like Hermione.”
   “I'm serious, Harry, don't go.”
   But Harry only had one thought his head, which was get back front mirror, and Ron wasn't going stop him.
   That third night he found his way more quickly than before. He was walking so fast he knew he was making more noise than was wise, but he didn't meet anyone.
   And there were his mother and father smiling him again, and one his grandfathers nodding happily. Harry sank down sit floor front mirror. There was nothing stop him staying here all night his family. Nothing all.
   Except—
   “So—back again, Harry?”
   Harry felt though his insides had turned ice. He looked behind him. Sitting one desks by wall was none other than Albus Dumbledore. Harry must have walked straight past him, so desperate get mirror he hadn't noticed him.
   “—I didn't see you, sir.”
   “Strange how nearsighted being invisible can make you,” said Dumbledore, and Harry was relieved see that he was smiling.
   “So,” said Dumbledore, slipping off desk sit floor Harry, “you, like hundreds before you, have discovered delights Mirror Erised.”
   “I didn't know it was called that, sir.”
   “But I expect you've realized by now what it does?”
   “It—well—it shows me my family—”
   “And it showed your friend Ron himself head boy.”
   “How did you know—?”
   “I don't need cloak become invisible,” said Dumbledore gently. “Now, can you think what Mirror Erised shows us all?”
   Harry shook his head.
   “Let me explain. happiest man earth would be able use Mirror Erised like normal mirror, that is, he would look it and see himself exactly he is. Does that help?”
   Harry thought. Then he said slowly, “It shows us what we want… whatever we want…”
   “Yes and no,” said Dumbledore quietly. “It shows us nothing more or less than deepest, most desperate desire our hearts. You, who have never known your family, see them standing around you. Ronald Weasley, who has always been overshadowed by his brothers, sees himself standing alone, best all them. However, this mirror will give us neither knowledge or truth. Men have wasted away before it, entranced by what they have seen, or been driven mad, not knowing if what it shows is real or even possible.
   “The Mirror will be moved new home tomorrow, Harry, and I ask you not go looking it again. If you ever do run across it, you will now be prepared. It does not do dwell dreams and forget live, remember that. Now, why don't you put that admirable cloak back and get off bed?”
   Harry stood up.
   “Sir—Professor Dumbledore? Can I ask you something?”
   “Obviously, you've just done so,” Dumbledore smiled. “You may ask me one more thing, however.”
   “What do you see when you look mirror?”
   “I? I see myself holding pair thick, woolen socks.”
   Harry stared.
   “One can never have enough socks,” said Dumbledore. “Another Christmas has come and gone and I didn't get single pair. People will insist giving me books.”
   It was only when he was back bed that it struck Harry that Dumbledore might not have been quite truthful. But then, he thought, he shoved Scabbers off his pillow, it had been quite personal question.
  

  

   

    13. NICOLAS FLAMEL
   

   Dumbledore had convinced Harry not go looking Mirror Erised again, and rest Christmas holidays Invisibility Cloak stayed folded bottom his trunk. Harry wished he could forget what he'd seen mirror easily, but he couldn't. He started having nightmares. Over and over again he dreamed his parents disappearing flash green light, while high voice cackled laughter.
   “You see, Dumbledore was right, that mirror could drive you mad,” said Ron, when Harry told him these dreams.
   Hermione, who came back day before term started, took different view things. She was torn between horror idea Harry being out bed, roaming school three nights row (“If Filch had caught you!”), and disappointment that he hadn't least found out who Nicolas Flamel was.
   They had almost given up hope ever finding Flamel library book, even though Harry was still sure he'd read name somewhere. Once term had started, they were back skimming through books ten minutes during their breaks. Harry had even less time than other two, because Quidditch practice had started again.
   Wood was working team harder than ever. Even endless rain that had replaced snow couldn't dampen his spirits. Weasleys complained that Wood was becoming fanatic, but Harry was Wood's side. If they won their next match, against Hufflepuff, they would overtake Slytherin house championship first time seven years. Quite apart wanting win, Harry found that he had fewer nightmares when he was tired out after training.
   Then, during one particularly wet and muddy practice session, Wood gave team bit bad news. He'd just gotten very angry Weasleys, who kept dive bombing each other and pretending fall off their brooms.
   “Will you stop messing around!” he yelled. “That's exactly sort thing that'll lose us match! Snape's refereeing this time, and he'll be looking any excuse knock points off Gryffindor!”
   George Weasley really did fall off his broom these words.
   “Snape's refereeing?” he spluttered through mouthful mud. “When's he ever refereed Quidditch match? He's not going be fair if we might overtake Slytherin.”
   rest team landed next George complain, too.
   “It's not my fault,” said Wood. “We've just got make sure we play clean game, so Snape hasn't got an excuse pick us.”
   Which was all very well, thought Harry, but he had another reason not wanting Snape near him while he was playing Quidditch…
   rest team hung back talk one another usual end practice, but Harry headed straight back Gryffindor common room, where he found Ron and Hermione playing chess. Chess was only thing Hermione ever lost at, something Harry and Ron thought was very good her.
   “Don't talk me moment,” said Ron when Harry sat down next him, “I need concen—” He caught sight Harry's face. “What's matter you? You look terrible.”
   Speaking quietly so that no one else would hear, Harry told other two Snape's sudden, sinister desire be Quidditch referee.
   “Don't play,” said Hermione once.
   “Say you're ill,” said Ron.
   “Pretend break your leg,” Hermione suggested.
   “Really break your leg,” said Ron.
   “I can't,” said Harry. “There isn't reserve Seeker. If I back out, Gryffindor can't play all.”
   that moment Neville toppled common room. How he had managed climb through portrait hole was anyone's guess, because his legs had been stuck together what they recognized once Leg Locker Curse. He must have had bunny hop all way up Gryffindor tower.
   Everyone fell over laughing except Hermione, who leapt up and performed countercurse. Neville's legs sprang apart and he got his feet, trembling. “What happened?” Hermione asked him, leading him over sit Harry and Ron.
   “Malfoy,” said Neville shakily. “I met him outside library. He said he'd been looking someone practice that on.”
   “Go Professor McGonagall!” Hermione urged Neville. “Report him!”
   Neville shook his head.
   “I don't want more trouble,” he mumbled.
   “You've got stand up him, Neville!” said Ron. “He's used walking all over people, but that's no reason lie down front him and make it easier.”
   “There's no need tell me I'm not brave enough be Gryffindor, Malfoy's already done that,” Neville choked out.
   Harry felt pocket his robes and pulled out Chocolate Frog, very last one box Hermione had given him Christmas. He gave it Neville, who looked though he might cry.
   “You're worth twelve Malfoy,” Harry said. “The Sorting Hat chose you Gryffindor, didn't it? And where's Malfoy? stinking Slytherin.”
   Neville's lips twitched weak smile he unwrapped frog.
   “Thanks, Harry… I think I'll go bed… D'you want card, you collect them, don't you?”
   Neville walked away, Harry looked Famous Wizard card.
   “Dumbledore again,” he said, “He was first one I ever—”
   He gasped. He stared back card. Then he looked up Ron and Hermione.
   “I've found him!” he whispered. “I've found Flamel! I told you I'd read name somewhere before, I read it train coming here—listen this: ‘Dumbledore is particularly famous his defeat dark wizard Grindelwald 1945, discovery twelve uses dragon's blood, and his work alchemy his partner, Nicolas Flamel'!”
   Hermione jumped her feet. She hadn't looked so excited since they'd gotten back marks their very first piece homework.
   “Stay there!” she said, and she sprinted up stairs girls' dormitories. Harry and Ron barely had time exchange mystified looks before she was dashing back, an enormous old book her arms.
   “I never thought look here!” she whispered excitedly. “I got this out library weeks ago bit light reading.”
   “Light?” said Ron, but Hermione told him be quiet until she'd looked something up, and started flicking frantically through pages, muttering herself.
   last she found what she was looking for.
   “I knew it! I knew it!”
   “Are we allowed speak yet?” said Ron grumpily. Hermione ignored him.
   “Nicolas Flamel,” she whispered dramatically, “is only known maker Sorcerer's Stone!”
   This didn't have quite effect she'd expected.
   “The what?” said Harry and Ron.
   “Oh, honestly, don't you two read? Look—read that, there.”
   She pushed book toward them, and Harry and Ron read:
   
    ancient study alchemy is concerned making Sorcerer's Stone, legendary substance astonishing powers. stone will transform any metal pure gold. It also produces Elixir Life, which will make drinker immortal.
    There have been many reports Sorcerer's Stone over centuries, but only Stone currently existence belongs Mr. Nicolas Flamel, noted alchemist and opera lover. Mr. Flamel, who celebrated his six hundred and sixty fifth birthday last year, enjoys quiet life Devon his wife, Perenelle (six hundred and fifty eight).
   
   “See?” said Hermione, when Harry and Ron had finished. “The dog must be guarding Flamel's Sorcerer's Stone! I bet he asked Dumbledore keep it safe him, because they're friends and he knew someone was after it, that's why he wanted Stone moved out Gringotts!”
   “A stone that makes gold and stops you ever dying!” said Harry. “No wonder Snape's after it! Anyone would want it.”
   “And no wonder we couldn't find Flamel that Study Recent Developments Wizardry,” said Ron. “He's not exactly recent if he's six hundred and sixty five, is he?”
   next morning Defense Against Dark Arts, while copying down different ways treating werewolf bites, Harry and Ron were still discussing what they'd do Sorcerer's Stone if they had one. It wasn't until Ron said he'd buy his own Quidditch team that Harry remembered Snape and coming match.
   “I'm going play,” he told Ron and Hermione. “If I don't, all Slytherins will think I'm just too scared face Snape. I'll show them… it'll really wipe smiles off their faces if we win.”
   “Just long we're not wiping you off field,” said Hermione.
   match drew nearer, however, Harry became more and more nervous, whatever he told Ron and Hermione. rest team wasn't too calm, either. idea overtaking Slytherin house championship was wonderful, no one had done it seven years, but would they be allowed to, such biased referee?
   Harry didn't know whether he was imagining it or not, but he seemed keep running Snape wherever he went. times, he even wondered whether Snape was following him, trying catch him his own. Potions lessons were turning sort weekly torture, Snape was so horrible Harry. Could Snape possibly know they'd found out Sorcerer's Stone? Harry didn't see how he could—yet he sometimes had horrible feeling that Snape could read minds.
   Harry knew, when they wished him good luck outside locker rooms next afternoon, that Ron and Hermione were wondering whether they'd ever see him alive again. This wasn't what you'd call comforting. Harry hardly heard word Wood's pep talk he pulled his Quidditch robes and picked up his Nimbus Two Thousand.
   Ron and Hermione, meanwhile, had found place stands next Neville, who couldn't understand why they looked so grim and worried, or why they had both brought their wands match. Little did Harry know that Ron and Hermione had been secretly practicing Leg Locker Curse. They'd gotten idea Malfoy using it Neville, and were ready use it Snape if he showed any sign wanting hurt Harry.
   “Now, don't forget, it's Locomotor Mortis,” Hermione muttered Ron slipped his wand up his sleeve.
   “I know,” Ron snapped. “Don't nag.”
   Back locker room, Wood had taken Harry aside.
   “Don't want pressure you, Potter, but if we ever need an early capture Snitch it's now. Finish game before Snape can favor Hufflepuff too much.”
   “The whole school's out there!” said Fred Weasley, peering out door. “Even—blimey—Dumbledore's come watch!”
   Harry's heart did somersault.
   “Dumbledore?” he said, dashing door make sure. Fred was right. There was no mistaking that silver beard.
   Harry could have laughed out loud relief—He was safe. There was simply no way that Snape would dare try hurt him if Dumbledore was watching.
   Perhaps that was why Snape was looking so angry teams marched onto field, something that Ron noticed, too.
   “I've never seen Snape look so mean,” he told Hermione. “Look they're off—Ouch!”
   Someone had poked Ron back head. It was Malfoy.
   “Oh, sorry, Weasley, didn't see you there.”
   Malfoy grinned broadly Crabbe and Goyle.
   “Wonder how long Potter's going stay his broom this time? Anyone want bet? What you, Weasley?”
   Ron didn't answer; Snape had just awarded Hufflepuff penalty because George Weasley had hit Bludger him. Hermione, who had all her fingers crossed her lap, was squinting fixedly Harry, who was circling game like hawk, looking Snitch.
   “You know how I think they choose people Gryffindor team?” said Malfoy loudly few minutes later, Snape awarded Hufflepuff another penalty no reason all. “It's people they feel sorry for. See, there's Potter, who's got no parents, then there's Weasleys, who've got no money—you should be team, Longbottom, you've got no brains.”
   Neville went bright red but turned his seat face Malfoy.
   “I'm worth twelve you, Malfoy,” he stammered.
   Malfoy, Crabbe, and Goyle howled laughter, but Ron, still not daring take his eyes game, said, “You tell him, Neville.”
   “Longbottom, if brains were gold you'd be poorer than Weasley, and that's saying something.”
   Ron's nerves were already stretched breaking point anxiety Harry.
   “I'm warning you, Malfoy—one more word—”
   “Ron!” said Hermione suddenly, “Harry—”
   “What? Where?”
   Harry had suddenly gone spectacular dive, which drew gasps and cheers crowd. Hermione stood up, her crossed fingers her mouth, Harry streaked toward ground like bullet.
   “You're luck, Weasley, Potter's obviously spotted some money ground!” said Malfoy.
   Ron snapped. Before Malfoy knew what was happening, Ron was top him, wrestling him ground. Neville hesitated, then clambered over back his seat help.
   “Come on, Harry!” Hermione screamed, leaping onto her seat watch Harry sped straight Snape—she didn't even notice Malfoy and Ron rolling around under her seat, or scuffles and yelps coming whirl fists that was Neville, Crabbe, and Goyle.
   Up air, Snape turned his broomstick just time see something scarlet shoot past him, missing him by inches—the next second, Harry had pulled out dive, his arm raised triumph, Snitch clasped his hand.
   stands erupted; it had be record, no one could ever remember Snitch being caught so quickly.
   “Ron! Ron! Where are you? game's over! Harry's won! We've won! Gryffindor is lead!” shrieked Hermione, dancing up and down her seat and hugging Parvati Patil row front.
   Harry jumped off his broom, foot ground. He couldn't believe it. He'd done it—the game was over; it had barely lasted five minutes. Gryffindors came spilling onto field, he saw Snape land nearby, white faced and tight lipped—then Harry felt hand his shoulder and looked up Dumbledore's smiling face.
   “Well done,” said Dumbledore quietly, so that only Harry could hear. “Nice see you haven't been brooding that mirror… been keeping busy… excellent…”
   Snape spat bitterly ground.
   Harry left locker room alone some time later, take his Nimbus Two Thousand back broomshed. He couldn't ever remember feeling happier. He'd really done something be proud now—no one could say he was just famous name any more. evening air had never smelled so sweet. He walked over damp grass, reliving last hour his head, which was happy blur: Gryffindors running lift him onto their shoulders; Ron and Hermione distance, jumping up and down, Ron cheering through heavy nosebleed.
   Harry had reached shed. He leaned against wooden door and looked up Hogwarts, its windows glowing red setting sun. Gryffindor lead. He'd done it, he'd shown Snape…
   And speaking Snape…
   hooded figure came swiftly down front steps castle. Clearly not wanting be seen, it walked fast possible toward forbidden forest. Harry's victory faded his mind he watched. He recognized figure's prowling walk. Snape, sneaking forest while everyone else was dinner—what was going on?
   Harry jumped back his Nimbus Two Thousand and took off. Gliding silently over castle he saw Snape enter forest run. He followed.
   trees were so thick he couldn't see where Snape had gone. He flew circles, lower and lower, brushing top branches trees until he heard voices. He glided toward them and landed noiselessly towering beech tree.
   He climbed carefully along one branches, holding tight his broomstick, trying see through leaves.
   Below, shadowy clearing, stood Snape, but he wasn't alone. Quirrell was there, too. Harry couldn't make out look his face, but he was stuttering worse than ever. Harry strained catch what they were saying.
   “…d-don't know why you wanted t-t-to meet here all p-places, Severus…”
   “Oh, I thought we'd keep this private,” said Snape, his voice icy. “Students aren't supposed know Sorcerer's Stone, after all.”
   Harry leaned forward. Quirrell was mumbling something. Snape interrupted him.
   “Have you found out how get past that beast Hagrid's yet?”
   “B-b-but Severus, I—”
   “You don't want me your enemy, Quirrell,” said Snape, taking step toward him.
   “I—I don't know what you—”
   “You know perfectly well what I mean.”
   An owl hooted loudly, and Harry nearly fell out tree. He steadied himself time hear Snape say, “—your little bit hocus pocus. I'm waiting.”
   “B-but I d-d-don't—”
   “Very well,” Snape cut in. “We'll have another little chat soon, when you've had time think things over and decided where your loyalties lie.”
   He threw his cloak over his head and strode out clearing. It was almost dark now, but Harry could see Quirrell, standing quite still though he was petrified.
   
* * *

   “Harry, where have you been?” Hermione squeaked.
   “We won! You won! We won!” shouted Ron, thumping Harry back. “And I gave Malfoy black eye, and Neville tried take Crabbe and Goyle single handed! He's still out cold but Madam Pomftey says he'll be all right—talk showing Slytherin! Everyone's waiting you common room, we're having party, Fred and George stole some cakes and stuff kitchens.”
   “Never mind that now,” said Harry breathlessly. “Let's find an empty room, you wait 'til you hear this…”
   He made sure Peeves wasn't inside before shutting door behind them, then he told them what he'd seen and heard.
   “So we were right, it is Sorcerer's Stone, and Snape's trying force Quirrell help him get it. He asked if he knew how get past Fluffy—and he said something Quirrell's ‘hocus pocuss'—I reckon there are other things guarding stone apart Fluffy, loads enchantments, probably, and Quirrell would have done some anti Dark Arts spell that Snape needs break through—”
   “So you mean Stone's only safe long Quirrell stands up Snape?” said Hermione alarm.
   “It'll be gone by next Tuesday,” said Ron.
  

  

   

    14. NORBERT NORWEGIAN RIDGEBACK
   

   Quirrell, however, must have been braver than they'd thought. weeks that followed he did seem be getting paler and thinner, but it didn't look though he'd cracked yet.
   Every time they passed third floor corridor, Harry, Ron, and Hermione would press their ears door check that Fluffy was still growling inside. Snape was sweeping his usual bad temper, which surely meant that Stone was still safe. Whenever Harry passed Quirrell these days he gave him an encouraging sort smile, and Ron had started telling people off laughing Quirrell's stutter.
   Hermione, however, had more her mind than Sorcerer's Stone. She had started drawing up study schedules and colorcoding all her notes. Harry and Ron wouldn't have minded, but she kept nagging them do same.
   “Hermione, exams are ages away.”
   “Ten weeks,” Hermione snapped. “That's not ages, that's like second Nicolas Flamel.”
   “But we're not six hundred years old,” Ron reminded her. “Anyway, what are you studying for, you already know it's an A.”
   “What am I studying for? Are you crazy? You realize we need pass these exams get second year? They're very important, I should have started studying month ago, I don't know what's gotten me…”
   Unfortunately, teachers seemed be thinking along same lines Hermione. They piled so much homework them that Easter holidays weren't nearly much fun Christmas ones. It was hard relax Hermione next you reciting twelve uses dragon's blood or practicing wand movements. Moaning and yawning, Harry and Ron spent most their free time library her, trying get through all their extra work.
   “I'll never remember this,” Ron burst out one afternoon, throwing down his quill and looking longingly out library window. It was first really fine day they'd had months. sky was clear, forget me not blue, and there was feeling air summer coming.
   Harry, who was looking up “Dittany” One Thousand Magical Herbs and Fungi, didn't look up until he heard Ron say, “Hagrid! What are you doing library?”
   Hagrid shuffled view, hiding something behind his back. He looked very out place his moleskin overcoat.
   “Jus' lookin',” he said, shifty voice that got their interest once. “An' what're you lot up ter?” He looked suddenly suspicious. “Yer not still lookin' fer Nicolas Flamel, are yeh?”
   “Oh, we found out who he is ages ago,” said Ron impressively. “And we know what that dog's guarding, it's Sorcerer's St—”
   “Shhhh!” Hagrid looked around quickly see if anyone was listening. “Don' go shoutin' it, what's matter yeh?”
   “There are few things we wanted ask you, matter fact,” said Harry, “about what's guarding Stone apart Fluffy—”
   “SHHHH!” said Hagrid again. “Listen—come an' see me later, I'm not promisin' I'll tell yeh anythin', mind, but don' go rabbitin' it here, students aren' s'pposed ter know. They'll think I've told yeh—”
   “See you later, then,” said Harry.
   Hagrid shuffled off.
   “What was he hiding behind his back?” said Hermione thoughtfully.
   “Do you think it had anything do Stone?”
   “I'm going see what section he was in,” said Ron, who'd had enough working. He came back minute later pile books his arms and slammed them down table.
   “Dragons!” he whispered. “Hagrid was looking up stuff dragons! Look these: Dragon Species Great Britain and Ireland; Egg Inferno, Dragon Keeper's Guide.”
   “Hagrid's always wanted dragon, he told me so first time I ever met him,” said Harry.
   “But it's against our laws,” said Ron. “Dragon breeding was outlawed by Warlocks' Convention 1709, everyone knows that. It's hard stop Muggles noticing us if we're keeping dragons back garden—anyway, you can't tame dragons, it's dangerous. You should see burns Charlie's got off wild ones Romania.”
   “But there aren't wild dragons Britain?” said Harry.
   “Of course there are,” said Ron. “Common Welsh Green and Hebridean Blacks. Ministry Magic has job hushing them up, I can tell you. Our kind have keep putting spells Muggles who've spotted them, make them forget.”
   “So what earths Hagrid up to?” said Hermione.
   When they knocked door gamekeeper's hut an hour later, they were surprised see that all curtains were closed. Hagrid called “Who is it?” before he let them in, and then shut door quickly behind them.
   It was stifling hot inside. Even though it was such warm day, there was blazing fire grate. Hagrid made them tea and offered them stoat sandwiches, which they refused.
   “So—yeh wanted ask me somethin'?”
   “Yes,” said Harry. There was no point beating around bush. “We were wondering if you could tell us what's guarding Sorcerer's Stone apart Fluffy.”
   Hagrid frowned him.
   “O' course I can't,” he said. “Number one, I don' know meself. Number two, yeh know too much already, so I wouldn' tell yeh if I could. That Stone's here fer good reason. It was almost stolen outta Gringotts—I s'ppose yeh've worked that out an' all? Beats me how yeh even know abou' Fluffy.”
   “Oh, come on, Hagrid, you might not want tell us, but you do know, you know everything that goes round here,” said Hermione warm, flattering voice. Hagrid's beard twitched and they could tell he was smiling. “We only wondered who had done guarding, really.” Hermione went on. “We wondered who Dumbledore had trusted enough help him, apart you.”
   Hagrid's chest swelled these last words. Harry and Ron beamed Hermione.
   “Well, I don' s'pose it could hurt ter tell yeh that… let's see… he borrowed Fluffy me… then some o' teachers did enchantments… Professor Sprout—Professor Flitwick—Professor McGonagall—” he ticked them off his fingers, “Professor Quirrell—an' Dumbledore himself did somethin', o' course. Hang on, I've forgotten someone. Oh yeah, Professor Snape.”
   “Snape?”
   “Yeah—yer not still abou' that, are yeh? Look, Snape helped protect Stone, he's not ter steal it.”
   Harry knew Ron and Hermione were thinking same he was. If Snape had been protecting Stone, it must have been easy find out how other teachers had guarded it. He probably knew everything—except, it seemed, Quirrell's spell and how get past Fluffy.
   “You're only one who knows how get past Fluffy, aren't you, Hagrid?” said Harry anxiously. “And you wouldn't tell anyone, would you? Not even one teachers?”
   “Not soul knows except me an' Dumbledore,” said Hagrid proudly.
   “Well, that's something,” Harry muttered others. “Hagrid, can we have window open? I'm boiling.”
   “Can't, Harry, sorry,” said Hagrid. Harry noticed him glance fire. Harry looked it, too.
   “Hagrid—what's that?”
   But he already knew what it was. very heart fire, underneath kettle, was huge, black egg.
   “Ah,” said Hagrid, fiddling nervously his beard, “That's er…”
   “Where did you get it, Hagrid?” said Ron, crouching over fire get closer look egg. “It must've cost you fortune.”
   “Won it,” said Hagrid. “Las' night. I was down village havin' few drinks an' got game o' cards stranger. Think he was quite glad ter get rid it, ter be honest.”
   “But what are you going do it when it's hatched?” said Hermione.
   “Well, I've bin doin' some readin',” said Hagrid, pulling large book under his pillow. “Got this outta library—Dragon Breeding Pleasure and Profit—it's bit outta date, o' course, but it's all here. Keep egg fire, 'cause their mothers breathe I em, see, an' when it hatches, feed it bucket o' brandy mixed chicken blood every half hour. An' see here—how ter recognize diff'rent eggs—what I got there's Norwegian Ridgeback. They're rare, them.”
   He looked very pleased himself, but Hermione didn't.
   “Hagrid, you live wooden house,” she said.
   But Hagrid wasn't listening. He was humming merrily he stoked fire.
   So now they had something else worry about: what might happen Hagrid if anyone found out he was hiding an illegal dragon his hut.
   “Wonder what it's like have peaceful life,” Ron sighed, evening after evening they struggled through all extra homework they were getting. Hermione had now started making study schedules Harry and Ron, too. It was driving them nuts.
   Then, one breakfast time, Hedwig brought Harry another note Hagrid. He had written only two words: It's hatching.
   Ron wanted skip Herbology and go straight down hut. Hermione wouldn't hear it.
   “Hermione, how many times our lives are we going see dragon hatching?”
   “We've got lessons, we'll get trouble, and that's nothing what Hagrid's going be when someone finds out what he's doing—”
   “Shut up!” Harry whispered.
   Malfoy was only few feet away and he had stopped dead listen. How much had he heard? Harry didn't like look Malfoy's face all.
   Ron and Hermione argued all way Herbology and end, Hermione agreed run down Hagrid's other two during morning break. When bell sounded castle end their lesson, three them dropped their trowels once and hurried through grounds edge forest. Hagrid greeted them, looking flushed and excited.
   “It's nearly out.” He ushered them inside.
   egg was lying table. There were deep cracks it. Something was moving inside; funny clicking noise was coming it.
   They all drew their chairs up table and watched bated breath.
   All once there was scraping noise and egg split open. baby dragon flopped onto table. It wasn't exactly pretty; Harry thought it looked like crumpled, black umbrella. Its spiny wings were huge compared its skinny jet body, it had long snout wide nostrils, stubs horns and bulging, orange eyes.
   It sneezed. couple sparks flew out its snout.
   “Isn't he beautiful?” Hagrid murmured. He reached out hand stroke dragon's head. It snapped his fingers, showing pointed fangs.
   “Bless him, look, he knows his mommy!” said Hagrid.
   “Hagrid,” said Hermione, “how fast do Norwegian Ridgebacks grow, exactly?”
   Hagrid was answer when color suddenly drained his face—he leapt his feet and ran window.
   “What's matter?”
   “Someone was lookin' through gap curtains—it's kid—he's runnin' back up ter school.”
   Harry bolted door and looked out. Even distance there was no mistaking him.
   Malfoy had seen dragon.
   Something smile lurking Malfoy's face during next week made Harry, Ron, and Hermione very nervous. They spent most their free time Hagrid's darkened hut, trying reason him.
   “Just let him go,” Harry urged. “Set him free.”
   “I can't,” said Hagrid. “He's too little. He'd die.”
   They looked dragon. It had grown three times length just week. Smoke kept furling out its nostrils. Hagrid hadn't been doing his gamekeeping duties because dragon was keeping him so busy. There were empty brandy bottles and chicken feathers all over floor.
   “I've decided call him Norbert,” said Hagrid, looking dragon misty eyes. “He really knows me now, watch. Norbert! Norbert! Where's Mommy?”
   “He's lost his marbles,” Ron muttered Harry's ear.
   “Hagrid,” said Harry loudly, “give it two weeks and Norbert's going be long your house. Malfoy could go Dumbledore any moment.”
   Hagrid bit his lip.
   “I—I know I can't keep him forever, but I can't jus' dump him, I can't.”
   Harry suddenly turned Ron. “Charlie,” he said.
   “You're losing it, too,” said Ron. “I'm Ron, remember?”
   “No—Charlie—your brother, Charlie. Romania. Studying dragons. We could send Norbert him. Charlie can take care him and then put him back wild!”
   “Brilliant!” said Ron. “How it, Hagrid?”
   And end, Hagrid agreed that they could send an owl Charlie ask him.
   following week dragged by. Wednesday night found Hermione and Harry sitting alone common room, long after everyone else had gone bed. clock wall had just chimed midnight when portrait hole burst open. Ron appeared out nowhere he pulled off Harry's Invisibility Cloak. He had been down Hagrid's hut, helping him feed Norbert, who was now eating dead rats by crate.
   “It bit me!” he said, showing them his hand, which was wrapped bloody handkerchief. “I'm not going be able hold quill week. I tell you, that dragon's most horrible animal I've ever met, but way Hagrid goes it, you'd think it was fluffy little bunny rabbit. When it bit me he told me off frightening it. And when I left, he was singing it lullaby.”
   There was tap dark window.
   “It's Hedwig!” said Harry, hurrying let her in. “She'll have Charlie's answer!”
   three them put their heads together read note.
   
    Dear Ron,
    How are you? Thanks letter—I'd be glad take Norwegian Ridgeback, but it won't be easy getting him here. I think best thing will be send him over some friends mine who are coming visit me next week. Trouble is, they mustn't be seen carrying an illegal dragon.
    Could you get Ridgeback up tallest tower midnight Saturday? They can meet you there and take him away while it's still dark.
    Send me an answer soon possible.
    Love,
    Charlie
   
   They looked one another.
   “We've got Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It shouldn't be too difficult—I think cloaks big enough cover two us and Norbert.”
   It was mark how bad last week had been that other two agreed him. Anything get rid Norbert—and Malfoy.
   There was hitch. By next morning, Ron's bitten hand had swollen twice its usual size. He didn't know whether it was safe go Madam Pomfrey—would she recognize dragon bite? By afternoon, though, he had no choice. cut had turned nasty shade green. It looked if Norbert's fangs were poisonous.
   Harry and Hermione rushed up hospital wing end day find Ron terrible state bed.
   “It's not just my hand,” he whispered, “although that feels like it's fall off. Malfoy told Madam Pomfrey he wanted borrow one my books so he could come and have good laugh me. He kept threatening tell her what really bit me—I've told her it was dog, but I don't think she believes me. I shouldn't have hit him Quidditch match, that's why he's doing this.”
   Harry and Hermione tried calm Ron down.
   “It'll all be over midnight Saturday,” said Hermione, but this didn't soothe Ron all. contrary, he sat bolt upright and broke sweat.
   “Midnight Saturday!” he said hoarse voice. “Oh no—oh no—I've just remembered—Charlie's letter was that book Malfoy took, he's going know we're getting rid Norbert.”
   Harry and Hermione didn't get chance answer. Madam Pomfrey came over that moment and made them leave, saying Ron needed sleep.
   “It's too late change plan now,” Harry told Hermione. “We haven't got time send Charlie another owl, and this could be our only chance get rid Norbert. We'll have risk it. And we have got Invisibility Cloak, Malfoy doesn't know that.”
   They found Fang, boarhound, sitting outside bandaged tail when they went tell Hagrid, who opened window talk them.
   “I won't let you in,” he puffed. “Norbert's tricky stage—nothin' I can't handle.”
   When they told him Charlie's letter, his eyes filled tears, although that might have been because Norbert had just bitten him leg.
   “Aargh! It's all right, he only got my boot—jus' playin'—he's only baby, after all.”
   baby banged its tail wall, making windows rattle. Harry and Hermione walked back castle feeling Saturday couldn't come quickly enough.
   They would have felt sorry Hagrid when time came him say good bye Norbert if they hadn't been so worried what they had do. It was very dark, cloudy night, and they were bit late arriving Hagrid's hut because they'd had wait Peeves get out their way entrance hall, where he'd been playing tennis against wall. Hagrid had Norbert packed and ready large crate.
   “He's got lots o' rats an' some brandy fer journey,” said Hagrid muffled voice. “An' I've packed his teddy bear case he gets lonely.”
   inside crate came ripping noises that sounded Harry though teddy was having his head torn off.
   “Bye bye, Norbert!” Hagrid sobbed, Harry and Hermione covered crate Invisibility Cloak and stepped underneath it themselves. “Mommy will never forget you!”
   How they managed get crate back up castle, they never knew. Midnight ticked nearer they heaved Norbert up marble staircase entrance hall and along dark corridors. Up another staircase, then another—even one Harry's shortcuts didn't make work much easier.
   “Nearly there!” Harry panted they reached corridor beneath tallest tower.
   Then sudden movement ahead them made them almost drop crate. Forgetting that they were already invisible, they shrank shadows, staring dark outlines two people grappling each other ten feet away. lamp flared.
   Professor McGonagall, tartan bathrobe and hair net, had Malfoy by ear.
   “Detention!” she shouted. “And twenty points Slytherin! Wandering around middle night, how dare you—”
   “You don't understand, Professor. Harry Potter's coming—he's got dragon!”
   “What utter rubbish! How dare you tell such lies! Come on—I shall see Professor Snape you, Malfoy!”
   steep spiral staircase up top tower seemed easiest thing world after that. Not until they'd stepped out cold night air did they throw off cloak, glad be able breathe properly again. Hermione did sort jig.
   “Malfoy's got detention! I could sing!”
   “Don't,” Harry advised her.
   Chuckling Malfoy, they waited, Norbert thrashing his crate. ten minutes later, four broomsticks came swooping down out darkness.
   Charlie's friends were cheery lot. They showed Harry and Hermione harness they'd rigged up, so they could suspend Norbert between them. They all helped buckle Norbert safely it and then Harry and Hermione shook hands others and thanked them very much.
   last, Norbert was going… going… gone.
   They slipped back down spiral staircase, their hearts light their hands, now that Norbert was off them. No more dragon—Malfoy detention—what could spoil their happiness?
   answer that was waiting foot stairs. they stepped corridor, Filch's face loomed suddenly out darkness.
   “Well, well, well,” he whispered, “we are trouble.”
   They'd left Invisibility Cloak top tower.
  

  

   

    15. FORBIDDEN FOREST
   

   Things couldn't have been worse.
   Filch took them down Professor McGonagall's study first floor, where they sat and waited without saying word each other. Hermione was trembling. Excuses, alibis, and wild cover-up stories chased each other around Harry's brain, each more feeble than last. He couldn't see how they were going get out trouble this time. They were cornered. How could they have been so stupid forget cloak? There was no reason earth that Professor McGonagall would accept their being out bed and creeping around school dead night, let alone being up tallest astronomy tower, which was out-of-bounds except classes. Add Norbert and Invisibility Cloak, and they might well be packing their bags already.
   Had Harry thought that things couldn't have been worse? He was wrong. When Professor McGonagall appeared, she was leading Neville.
   “Harry!” Neville burst out, moment he saw other two. “I was trying find you warn you, I heard Malfoy saying he was going catch you, he said you had drag—”
   Harry shook his head violently shut Neville up, but Professor McGonagall had seen. She looked more likely breathe fire than Norbert she towered over three them.
   “I would never have believed it any you. Mr. Filch says you were up astronomy tower. It's one o'clock morning. Explain yourselves.”
   It was first time Hermione had ever failed answer teacher's question. She was staring her slippers, still statue.
   “I think I've got good idea what's been going on,” said Professor McGonagall. “It doesn't take genius work it out. You fed Draco Malfoy some cock and bull story dragon, trying get him out bed and trouble. I've already caught him. I suppose you think it's funny that Longbottom here heard story and believed it, too?”
   Harry caught Neville's eye and tried tell him without words that this wasn't true, because Neville was looking stunned and hurt. Poor, blundering Neville—Harry knew what it must have cost him try and find them dark, warn them.
   “I'm disgusted,” said Professor McGonagall. “Four students out bed one night! I've never heard such thing before! You, Miss Granger, I thought you had more sense. you, Mr. Potter, I thought Gryffindor meant more you than this. All three you will receive detentions—yes, you too, Mr. Longbottom, nothing gives you right walk around school night, especially these days, it's very dangerous—and fifty points will be taken Gryffindor.”
   “Fifty?” Harry gasped—they would lose lead, lead he'd won last Quidditch match.
   “Fifty points each,” said Professor McGonagall, breathing heavily through her long, pointed nose.
   “Professor—please—”
   “You can't—”
   “Don't tell me what I can and can't do, Potter. Now get back bed, all you. I've never been more ashamed Gryffindor students.”
   hundred and fifty points lost. That put Gryffindor last place. one night, they'd ruined any chance Gryffindor had had house cup. Harry felt though bottom had dropped out his stomach. How could they ever make up this?
   Harry didn't sleep all night. He could hear Neville sobbing his pillow what seemed like hours. Harry couldn't think anything say comfort him. He knew Neville, like himself, was dreading dawn. What would happen when rest Gryffindor found out what they'd done?
   first, Gryffindors passing giant hourglasses that recorded house points next day thought there'd been mistake. How could they suddenly have hundred and fifty points fewer than yesterday? And then story started spread: Harry Potter, famous Harry Potter, their hero two Quidditch matches, had lost them all those points, him and couple other stupid first years.
   being one most popular and admired people school, Harry was suddenly most hated. Even Ravenclaws and Hufflepuffs turned him, because everyone had been longing see Slytherin lose house cup. Everywhere Harry went, people pointed and didn't trouble lower their voices they insulted him. Slytherins, other hand, clapped he walked past them, whistling and cheering, “Thanks, Potter, we owe you one!”
   Only Ron stood by him.
   “They'll all forget this few weeks. Fred and George have lost loads points all time they've been here, and people still like them.”
   “They've never lost hundred and fifty points one go, though, have they?” said Harry miserably.
   “Well—no,” Ron admitted.
   It was bit late repair damage, but Harry swore himself not meddle things that weren't his business now on. He'd had it sneaking around and spying. He felt so ashamed himself that he went Wood and offered resign Quidditch team.
   “Resign?” Wood thundered. “What good'll that do? How are we going get any points back if we can't win Quidditch?”
   But even Quidditch had lost its fun. rest team wouldn't speak Harry during practice, and if they had speak him, they called him “the Seeker.”
   Hermione and Neville were suffering, too. They didn't have bad time Harry, because they weren't well known, but nobody would speak them, either. Hermione had stopped drawing attention herself class, keeping her head down and working silence.
   Harry was almost glad that exams weren't far away. All studying he had do kept his mind off his misery. He, Ron, and Hermione kept themselves, working late night, trying remember ingredients complicated potions, learn charms and spells by heart, memorize dates magical discoveries and goblin rebellions…
   Then, week before exams were due start, Harry's new resolution not interfere anything that didn't concern him was put an unexpected test. Walking back library his own one afternoon, he heard somebody whimpering classroom up ahead. he drew closer, he heard Quirrell's voice.
   “No—no—not again, please—”
   It sounded though someone was threatening him. Harry moved closer.
   “All right—all right—” he heard Quirrell sob.
   Next second, Quirrell came hurrying out classroom straightening his turban. He was pale and looked though he was cry. He strode out sight; Harry didn't think Quirrell had even noticed him. He waited until Quirrell's footsteps had disappeared, then peered classroom. It was empty, but door stood ajar other end. Harry was halfway toward it before he remembered what he'd promised himself not meddling.
   All same, he'd have gambled twelve Sorcerer's Stones that Snape had just left room, and what Harry had just heard, Snape would be walking new spring his step—Quirrell seemed have given last.
   Harry went back library, where Hermione was testing Ron Astronomy. Harry told them what he'd heard.
   “Snape's done it, then!” said Ron. “If Quirrell's told him how break his Anti Dark Force spell—”
   “There's still Fluffy, though,” said Hermione.
   “Maybe Snape's found out how get past him without asking Hagrid,” said Ron, looking up thousands books surrounding them. “I bet there's book somewhere here telling you how get past giant three headed dog. So what do we do, Harry?”
   light adventure was kindling again Ron's eyes, but Hermione answered before Harry could.
   “Go Dumbledore. That's what we should have done ages ago. If we try anything ourselves we'll be thrown out sure.”
   “But we've got no proof!” said Harry. “Quirrell's too scared back us up. Snape's only got say he doesn't know how troll got Halloween and that he was nowhere near third floor—who do you think they'll believe, him or us? It's not exactly secret we hate him, Dumbledore'll think we made it up get him sacked. Filch wouldn't help us if his life depended it, he's too friendly Snape, and more students get thrown out, better, he'll think. And don't forget, we're not supposed know Stone or Fluffy. That'll take lot explaining.”
   Hermione looked convinced, but Ron didn't.
   “If we just do bit poking around—”
   “No,” said Harry flatly, “we've done enough poking around.”
   He pulled map Jupiter toward him and started learn names its moons.
   following morning, notes were delivered Harry, Hermione, and Neville breakfast table. They were all same:
   
    Your detention will take place eleven o'clock tonight.
    Meet Mr. Filch entrance hall.
    Professor McGonagall
   
   Harry had forgotten they still had detentions do furor over points they'd lost. He half expected Hermione complain that this was whole night studying lost, but she didn't say word. Like Harry, she felt they deserved what they'd got.
   eleven o'clock that night, they said good bye Ron common room and went down entrance hall Neville. Filch was already there—and so was Malfoy. Harry had also forgotten that Malfoy had gotten detention, too.
   “Follow me,” said Filch, lighting lamp and leading them outside.
   “I bet you'll think twice breaking school rule again, won't you, eh?” he said, leering them. “Oh yes… hard work and pain are best teachers if you ask me… It's just pity they let old punishments die out… hang you by your wrists ceiling few days, I've got chains still my office, keep 'em well oiled case they're ever needed… Right, off we go, and don't think running off, now, it'll be worse you if you do.”
   They marched off across dark grounds. Neville kept sniffing. Harry wondered what their punishment was going be. It must be something really horrible, or Filch wouldn't be sounding so delighted.
   moon was bright, but clouds scudding across it kept throwing them darkness. Ahead, Harry could see lighted windows Hagrid's hut. Then they heard distant shout.
   “Is that you, Filch? Hurry up, I want ter get started.”
   Harry's heart rose; if they were going be working Hagrid it wouldn't be so bad. His relief must have showed his face, because Filch said, “I suppose you think you'll be enjoying yourself that oaf? Well, think again, boy—it's forest you're going and I'm much mistaken if you'll all come out one piece.”
   this, Neville let out little moan, and Malfoy stopped dead his tracks.
   “The forest?” he repeated, and he didn't sound quite cool usual. “We can't go there night—there's all sorts things there—werewolves, I heard.”
   Neville clutched sleeve Harry's robe and made choking noise.
   “That's your problem, isn't it?” said Filch, his voice cracking glee. “Should've thought them werewolves before you got trouble, shouldn't you?”
   Hagrid came striding toward them out dark, Fang his heel. He was carrying his large crossbow, and quiver arrows hung over his shoulder.
   “Abou' time,” he said. “I bin waitin' fer half an hour already. All right, Harry, Hermione?”
   “I shouldn't be too friendly them, Hagrid,” said Filch coldly, “they're here be punished, after all.”
   “That's why yer late, is it?” said Hagrid, frowning Filch. “Bin lecturin' them, eh? 'Snot your place ter do that. Yeh've done yer bit, I'll take over here.”
   “I'll be back dawn,” said Filch, “for what's left them,” he added nastily, and he turned and started back toward castle, his lamp bobbing away darkness.
   Malfoy now turned Hagrid.
   “I'm not going that forest,” he said, and Harry was pleased hear note panic his voice.
   “Yeh are if yeh want ter stay Hogwarts,” said Hagrid fiercely. “Yeh've done wrong an' now yeh've got ter pay fer it.”
   “But this is servant stuff, it's not students do. I thought we'd be copying lines or something, if my father knew I was doing this, he'd—”
   “—tell yer that's how it is Hogwarts,” Hagrid growled. “Copyin' lines! What good's that ter anyone? Yeh'll do summat useful or yeh'll get out. If yeh think yer father'd rather you were expelled, then get back off ter castle an' pack. Go on.”
   Malfoy didn't move. He looked Hagrid furiously, but then dropped his gaze.
   “Right then,” said Hagrid, “now, listen carefully, 'cause it's dangerous what we're gonna do tonight, an' I don' want no one takin' risks. Follow me over here moment.”
   He led them very edge forest. Holding his lamp up high, he pointed down narrow, winding earth track that disappeared thick black trees. light breeze lifted their hair they looked forest.
   “Look there,” said Hagrid, “see that stuff shinin' ground? Silvery stuff? That's unicorn blood. There's unicorn there bin hurt badly by summat. This is second time week. I found one dead last Wednesday. We're gonna try an' find poor thing. We might have ter put it out its misery.”
   “And what if whatever hurt unicorn finds us first?” said Malfoy, unable keep fear out his voice.
   “There's nothin' that lives forest that'll hurt yeh if yer me or Fang,” said Hagrid. “An' keep ter path. Right, now, we're gonna split inter two parties an' follow trail diff'rent directions. There's blood all over place, it must've bin staggerin' around since last night least.”
   “I want Fang,” said Malfoy quickly, looking Fang's long teeth.
   “All right, but I warn yeh, he's coward,” said Hagrid. “So me, Harry, an' Hermione'll go one way an' Draco, Neville, an' Fang'll go other. Now, if any us finds unicorn, we'll send up green sparks, right? Get yer wands out an' practice now—that's it—an' if anyone gets trouble, send up red sparks, an' we'll all come an' find yeh—so, be careful—let's go.”
   forest was black and silent. little way it they reached fork earth path, and Harry, Hermione, and Hagrid took left path while Malfoy, Neville, and Fang took right.
   They walked silence, their eyes ground. Every now and then ray moonlight through branches above lit spot silver blue blood fallen leaves.
   Harry saw that Hagrid looked very worried.
   “Could werewolf be killing unicorns?” Harry asked.
   “Not fast enough,” said Hagrid. “It's not easy ter catch unicorn, they're powerful magic creatures. I never knew one ter be hurt before.”
   They walked past mossy tree stump. Harry could hear running water; there must be stream somewhere close by. There were still spots unicorn blood here and there along winding path.
   “You all right, Hermione?” Hagrid whispered. “Don' worry, it can't've gone far if it's this badly hurt, an' then we'll be able ter—GET BEHIND THAT TREE!”
   Hagrid seized Harry and Hermione and hoisted them off path behind towering oak. He pulled out an arrow and fitted it his crossbow, raising it, ready fire. three them listened. Something was slithering over dead leaves nearby: it sounded like cloak trailing along ground. Hagrid was squinting up dark path, but after few seconds, sound faded away.
   “I knew it,” he murmured. “There's summat here that shouldn' be.”
   “A werewolf?” Harry suggested.
   “That wasn' no werewolf an' it wasn' no unicorn, neither,” said Hagrid grimly. “Right, follow me, but careful, now.”
   They walked more slowly, ears straining faintest sound. Suddenly, clearing ahead, something definitely moved.
   “Who's there?” Hagrid called. “Show yerself—I'm armed!”
   And clearing came—was it man, or horse? waist, man, red hair and beard, but below that was horse's gleaming chestnut body long, reddish tail. Harry and Hermione's jaws dropped.
   “Oh, it's you, Ronan,” said Hagrid relief. “How are yeh?”
   He walked forward and shook centaur's hand.
   “Good evening you, Hagrid,” said Ronan. He had deep, sorrowful voice. “Were you going shoot me?”
   “Can't be too careful, Ronan,” said Hagrid, patting his crossbow. “There's summat bad loose this forest. This is Harry Potter an' Hermione Granger, by way. Students up school. An' this is Ronan, you two. He's centaur.”
   “We'd noticed,” said Hermione faintly.
   “Good evening,” said Ronan. “Students, are you? And do you learn much, up school?”
   “Erm—”
   “A bit,” said Hermione timidly.
   “A bit. Well, that's something.” Ronan sighed. He flung back his head and stared sky. “Mars is bright tonight.”
   “Yeah,” said Hagrid, glancing up, too. “Listen, I'm glad we've run inter yeh, Ronan, 'cause there's unicorn bin hurt—you seen anythin'?”
   Ronan didn't answer immediately. He stared unblinkingly upward, then sighed again.
   “Always innocent are first victims,” he said. “So it has been ages past, so it is now.”
   “Yeah,” said Hagrid, “but have yeh seen anythin', Ronan? Anythin' unusual?”
   “Mars is bright tonight,” Ronan repeated, while Hagrid watched him impatiently. “Unusually bright.”
   “Yeah, but I was meanin' anythin' unusual bit nearer home, said Hagrid. “So yeh haven't noticed anythin' strange?”
   Yet again, Ronan took while answer. last, he said, “The forest hides many secrets.”
   movement trees behind Ronan made Hagrid raise his bow again, but it was only second centaur, black haired and bodied and wilder looking than Ronan.
   “Hullo, Bane,” said Hagrid. “All right?”
   “Good evening, Hagrid, I hope you are well?”
   “Well enough. Look, I've jus' bin askin' Ronan, you seen anythin' odd here lately? There's unicorn bin injured—would yeh know anythin' it?”
   Bane walked over stand next Ronan. He looked skyward. “Mars is bright tonight,” he said simply.
   “We've heard,” said Hagrid grumpily. “Well, if either you do see anythin', let me know, won't yeh? We'll be off, then.”
   Harry and Hermione followed him out clearing, staring over their shoulders Ronan and Bane until trees blocked their view.
   “Never,” said Hagrid irritably, “try an' get straight answer out centaur. Ruddy stargazers. Not interested anythin' closer'n moon.”
   “Are there many them here?” asked Hermione.
   “Oh, fair few… Keep themselves themselves mostly, but they're good enough turnin' up if ever I want word. They're deep mind, centaurs… they know things… jus' don' let much.”
   “D'you think that was centaur we heard earlier?” said Harry.
   “Did that sound like hooves you? Nah, if yeh ask me, that was what's bin killin' unicorns—never heard anythin' like it before.”
   They walked through dense, dark trees. Harry kept looking nervously over his shoulder. He had nasty feeling they were being watched. He was very glad they had Hagrid and his crossbow them. They had just passed bend path when Hermione grabbed Hagrid's arm.
   “Hagrid! Look! Red sparks, others are trouble!”
   “You two wait here!” Hagrid shouted. “Stay path, I'll come back yeh!”
   They heard him crashing away through undergrowth and stood looking each other, very scared, until they couldn't hear anything but rustling leaves around them.
   “You don't think they've been hurt, do you?” whispered Hermione.
   “I don't care if Malfoy has, but if something's got Neville… it's our fault he's here first place.”
   minutes dragged by. Their ears seemed sharper than usual. Harry's seemed be picking up every sigh wind, every cracking twig. What was going on? Where were others?
   last, great crunching noise announced Hagrid's return. Malfoy, Neville, and Fang were him. Hagrid was fuming. Malfoy, it seemed, had sneaked up behind Neville and grabbed him joke. Neville had panicked and sent up sparks.
   “We'll be lucky ter catch anythin' now, racket you two were makin'. Right, we're changin' groups—Neville, you stay me an' Hermione, Harry, you go Fang an' this idiot. I'm sorry,” Hagrid added whisper Harry, “but he'll have harder time frightenin' you, an' we've gotta get this done.”
   So Harry set off heart forest Malfoy and Fang. They walked nearly half an hour, deeper and deeper forest, until path became almost impossible follow because trees were so thick. Harry thought blood seemed be getting thicker. There were splashes roots tree, though poor creature had been thrashing around pain close by. Harry could see clearing ahead, through tangled branches an ancient oak.
   “Look—” he murmured, holding out his arm stop Malfoy.
   Something bright white was gleaming ground. They inched closer.
   It was unicorn all right, and it was dead. Harry had never seen anything so beautiful and sad. Its long, slender legs were stuck out odd angles where it had fallen and its mane was spread pearly white dark leaves.
   Harry had taken one step toward it when slithering sound made him freeze where he stood. bush edge clearing quivered… Then, out shadows, hooded figure came crawling across ground like some stalking beast. Harry, Malfoy, and Fang stood transfixed. cloaked figure reached unicorn, lowered its head over wound animal's side, and began drink its blood.
   “AAAAAAAAAARGH!”
   Malfoy let out terrible scream and bolted—so did Fang. hooded figure raised its head and looked right Harry—unicorn blood was dribbling down its front. It got its feet and came swiftly toward Harry—he couldn't move fear.
   Then pain like he'd never felt before pierced his head; it was though his scar were fire. Half blinded, he staggered backward. He heard hooves behind him, galloping, and something jumped clean over Harry, charging figure.
   pain Harry's head was so bad he fell his knees. It took minute or two pass. When he looked up, figure had gone. centaur was standing over him, not Ronan or Bane; this one looked younger; he had white blond hair and palomino body.
   “Are you all right?” said centaur, pulling Harry his feet.
   “Yes—thank you—what was that?”
   centaur didn't answer. He had astonishingly blue eyes, like pale sapphires. He looked carefully Harry, his eyes lingering scar that stood out, livid, Harry's forehead.
   “You are Potter boy,” he said. “You had better get back Hagrid. forest is not safe this time—especially you. Can you ride? It will be quicker this way.
   “My name is Firenze,” he added, he lowered himself his front legs so that Harry could clamber onto his back.
   There was suddenly sound more galloping other side clearing. Ronan and Bane came bursting through trees, their flanks heaving and sweaty.
   “Firenze!” Bane thundered. “What are you doing? You have human your back! Have you no shame? Are you common mule?”
   “Do you realize who this is?” said Firenze. “This is Potter boy. quicker he leaves this forest, better.”
   “What have you been telling him?” growled Bane. “Remember, Firenze, we are sworn not set ourselves against heavens. Have we not read what is come movements planets?”
   Ronan pawed ground nervously. “I'm sure Firenze thought he was acting best,” he said his gloomy voice.
   Bane kicked his back legs anger.
   “For best! What is that do us? Centaurs are concerned what has been foretold! It is not our business run around like donkeys after stray humans our forest!”
   Firenze suddenly reared his hind legs anger, so that Harry had grab his shoulders stay on.
   “Do you not see that unicorn?” Firenze bellowed Bane. “Do you not understand why it was killed? Or have planets not let you that secret? I set myself against what is lurking this forest, Bane, yes, humans alongside me if I must.”
   And Firenze whisked around; Harry clutching best he could, they plunged off trees, leaving Ronan and Bane behind them.
   Harry didn't have clue what was going on.
   “Why's Bane so angry?” he asked. “What was that thing you saved me from, anyway?”
   Firenze slowed walk, warned Harry keep his head bowed case low hanging branches, but did not answer Harry's question. They made their way through trees silence so long that Harry thought Firenze didn't want talk him anymore. They were passing through particularly dense patch trees, however, when Firenze suddenly stopped.
   “Harry Potter, do you know what unicorn blood is used for?”
   “No,” said Harry, startled by odd question. “We've only used horn and tail hair Potions.”
   “That is because it is monstrous thing, slay unicorn,” said Firenze. “Only one who has nothing lose, and everything gain, would commit such crime. blood unicorn will keep you alive, even if you are an inch death, but terrible price. You have slain something pure and defenseless save yourself, and you will have but half life, cursed life, moment blood touches your lips.”
   Harry stared back Firenze's head, which was dappled silver moonlight.
   “But who'd be that desperate?” he wondered aloud. “If you're going be cursed forever, death's better, isn't it?”
   “It is,” Firenze agreed, “unless all you need is stay alive long enough drink something else—something that will bring you back full strength and power—something that will mean you can never die. Mr. Potter, do you know what is hidden school this very moment?”
   “The Sorcerer's Stone! course—the Elixir Life! But I don't understand who—”
   “Can you think nobody who has waited many years return power, who has clung life, awaiting their chance?”
   It was though an iron fist had clenched suddenly around Harry's heart. Over rustling trees, he seemed hear once more what Hagrid had told him night they had met: “Some say he died. Codswallop, my opinion. Dunno if he had enough human left him die.”
   “Do you mean,” Harry croaked, “that was Vol—”
   “Harry! Harry, are you all right?”
   Hermione was running toward them down path, Hagrid puffing along behind her.
   “I'm fine,” said Harry, hardly knowing what he was saying. “The unicorn's dead, Hagrid, it's that clearing back there.”
   “This is where I leave you,” Firenze murmured Hagrid hurried off examine unicorn. “You are safe now.”
   Harry slid off his back.
   “Good luck, Harry Potter,” said Firenze. “The planets have been read wrongly before now, even by centaurs. I hope this is one those times.”
   He turned and cantered back depths forest, leaving Harry shivering behind him.
   Ron had fallen asleep dark common room, waiting them return. He shouted something Quidditch fouls when Harry roughly shook him awake. matter seconds, though, he was wide eyed Harry began tell him and Hermione what had happened forest.
   Harry couldn't sit down. He paced up and down front fire. He was still shaking.
   “Snape wants stone Voldemort… and Voldemort's waiting forest… and all this time we thought Snape just wanted get rich…”
   “Stop saying name!” said Ron terrified whisper, if he thought Voldemort could hear them.
   Harry wasn't listening.
   “Firenze saved me, but he shouldn't have done so… Bane was furious… he was talking interfering what planets say is going happen… They must show that Voldemort's coming back… Bane thinks Firenze should have let Voldemort kill me… I suppose that's written stars well.”
   “Will you stop saying name!” Ron hissed.
   “So all I've got wait now is Snape steal Stone,” Harry went feverishly, “then Voldemort will be able come and finish me off… Well, I suppose Bane'll be happy.”
   Hermione looked very frightened, but she had word comfort.
   “Harry, everyone says Dumbledore's only one You-Know-Who was ever afraid Dumbledore around, You-Know-Who won't touch you. Anyway, who says centaurs are right? It sounds like fortune telling me, and Professor McGonagall says that's very imprecise branch magic.”
   sky had turned light before they stopped talking. They went bed exhausted, their throats sore. But night's surprises weren't over.
   When Harry pulled back his sheets, he found his Invisibility Cloak folded neatly underneath them. There was note pinned it:
   
    Just case.
   
  

  

   

    16. THROUGH TRAPDOOR
   

   years come, Harry would never quite remember how he had managed get through his exams when he half expected Voldemort come bursting through door any moment. Yet days crept by, and there could be no doubt that Fluffy was still alive and well behind locked door.
   It was sweltering hot, especially large classroom where they did their written papers. They had been given special, new quills exams, which had been bewitched an AntiCheating spell.
   They had practical exams well. Professor Flitwick called them one by one his class see if they could make pineapple tapdance across desk. Professor McGonagall watched them turn mouse snuffbox—points were given how pretty snuffbox was, but taken away if it had whiskers. Snape made them all nervous, breathing down their necks while they tried remember how make Forgetfulness potion.
   Harry did best he could, trying ignore stabbing pains his forehead, which had been bothering him ever since his trip forest. Neville thought Harry had bad case exam nerves because Harry couldn't sleep, but truth was that Harry kept being woken by his old nightmare, except that it was now worse than ever because there was hooded figure dripping blood it.
   Maybe it was because they hadn't seen what Harry had seen forest, or because they didn't have scars burning their foreheads, but Ron and Hermione didn't seem worried Stone Harry. idea Voldemort certainly scared them, but he didn't keep visiting them dreams, and they were so busy their studying they didn't have much time fret what Snape or anyone else might be up to.
   Their very last exam was History Magic. One hour answering questions batty old wizards who'd invented selfstirring cauldrons and they'd be free, free whole wonderful week until their exam results came out. When ghost Professor Binns told them put down their quills and roll up their parchment, Harry couldn't help cheering rest.
   “That was far easier than I thought it would be,” said Hermione they joined crowds flocking out onto sunny grounds. “I needn't have learned 1637 Werewolf Code Conduct or uprising Elfric Eager.”
   Hermione always liked go through their exam papers afterward, but Ron said this made him feel ill, so they wandered down lake and flopped under tree. Weasley twins and Lee Jordan were tickling tentacles giant squid, which was basking warm shallows. “No more studying,” Ron sighed happily, stretching out grass. “You could look more cheerful, Harry, we've got week before we find out how badly we've done, there's no need worry yet.”
   Harry was rubbing his forehead.
   “I wish I knew what this means!” he burst out angrily. “My scar keeps hurting—it's happened before, but never often this.”
   “Go Madam Pomfrey,” Hermione suggested.
   “I'm not ill,” said Harry. “I think it's warning… it means danger's coming…”
   Ron couldn't get worked up, it was too hot.
   “Harry, relax, Hermione's right, Stone's safe long Dumbledore's around. Anyway, we've never had any proof Snape found out how get past Fluffy. He nearly had his leg ripped off once, he's not going try it again hurry. And Neville will play Quidditch England before Hagrid lets Dumbledore down.”
   Harry nodded, but he couldn't shake off lurking feeling that there was something he'd forgotten do, something important. When he tried explain this, Hermione said, “That's just exams. I woke up last night and was halfway through my Transfiguration notes before I remembered we'd done that one.”
   Harry was quite sure unsettled feeling didn't have anything do work, though. He watched an owl flutter toward school across bright blue sky, note clamped its mouth. Hagrid was only one who ever sent him letters. Hagrid would never betray Dumbledore. Hagrid would never tell anyone how get past Fluffy… never… but…
   Harry suddenly jumped his feet.
   “Where're you going?” said Ron sleepily.
   “I've just thought something,” said Harry. He had turned white. “We've got go and see Hagrid, now.”
   “Why?” panted Hermione, hurrying keep up.
   “Don't you think it's bit odd,” said Harry, scrambling up grassy slope, “that what Hagrid wants more than anything else is dragon, and stranger turns up who just happens have an egg his pocket? How many people wander around dragon eggs if it's against wizard law? Lucky they found Hagrid, don't you think? Why didn't I see it before?”
   “What are you talking about?” said Ron, but Harry, sprinting across grounds toward forest, didn't answer.
   Hagrid was sitting an armchair outside his house; his trousers and sleeves were rolled up, and he was shelling peas large bowl.
   “Hullo,” he said, smiling. “Finished yer exams? Got time fer drink?”
   “Yes, please,” said Ron, but Harry cut him off.
   “No, we're hurry. Hagrid, I've got ask you something. You know that night you won Norbert? What did stranger you were playing cards look like?”
   “Dunno,” said Hagrid casually, “he wouldn' take his cloak off.”
   He saw three them look stunned and raised his eyebrows.
   “It's not that unusual, yeh get lot o' funny folk Hog's Head—that's pub down village. Mighta bin dragon dealer, mightn' he? I never saw his face, he kept his hood up.”
   Harry sank down next bowl peas. “What did you talk him about, Hagrid? Did you mention Hogwarts all?”
   “Mighta come up,” said Hagrid, frowning he tried remember. “Yeah… he asked what I did, an' I told him I was gamekeeper here… He asked bit sorta creatures I took after… so I told him… an' I said what I'd always really wanted was dragon… an' then… I can' remember too well, 'cause he kept buyin' me drinks… Let's see… yeah, then he said he had dragon egg an' we could play cards fer it if I wanted… but he had ter be sure I could handle it, he didn' want it ter go ter any old home… So I told him, after Fluffy, dragon would be easy…”
   “And did he—did he seem interested Fluffy?” Harry asked, try ing keep his voice calm.
   “Well—yeah—how many three headed dogs d'yeh meet, even around Hogwarts? So I told him, Fluffy's piece o' cake if yeh know how calm him down, jus' play him bit o' music an' he'll go straight off ter sleep—”
   Hagrid suddenly looked horrified.
   “I shouldn'ta told yeh that!” he blurted out. “Forget I said it! Hey—where're yeh goin'?”
   Harry, Ron, and Hermione didn't speak each other all until they came halt entrance hall, which seemed very cold and gloomy after grounds.
   “We've got go Dumbledore,” said Harry. “Hagrid told that stranger how get past Fluffy, and it was either Snape or Voldemort under that cloak—it must've been easy, once he'd got Hagrid drunk. I just hope Dumbledore believes us. Firenze might back us up if Bane doesn't stop him. Where's Dumbledore's office?”
   They looked around, if hoping see sign pointing them right direction. They had never been told where Dumbledore lived, nor did they know anyone who had been sent see him.
   “We'll just have to—” Harry began, but voice suddenly rang across hall.
   “What are you three doing inside?”
   It was Professor McGonagall, carrying large pile books.
   “We want see Professor Dumbledore,” said Hermione, rather bravely, Harry and Ron thought.
   “See Professor Dumbledore?” Professor McGonagall repeated, though this was very fishy thing want do. “Why?”
   Harry swallowed—now what?
   “It's sort secret,” he said, but he wished once he hadn't, because Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared.
   “Professor Dumbledore left ten minutes ago,” she said coldly. “He received an urgent owl Ministry Magic and flew off London once.”
   “He's gone?” said Harry frantically. “Now?”
   “Professor Dumbledore is very great wizard, Potter, he has many demands his time—”
   “But this is important.”
   “Something you have say is more important than Ministry Magic, Potter?”
   “Look,” said Harry, throwing caution winds, “Professor—it's Sorcerer's stone—”
   Whatever Professor McGonagall had expected, it wasn't that. books she was carrying tumbled out her arms, but she didn't pick them up. “How do you know ?” she spluttered.
   “Professor, I think—I know—that Sn—that someone's going try and steal Stone. I've got talk Professor Dumbledore.”
   She eyed him mixture shock and suspicion.
   “Professor Dumbledore will be back tomorrow,” she said finally. “I don't know how you found out Stone, but rest assured, no one can possibly steal it, it's too well protected.”
   “But Professor—”
   “Potter, I know what I'm talking about,” she said shortly. She bent down and gathered up fallen books. “I suggest you all go back outside and enjoy sunshine.”
   But they didn't.
   “It's tonight,” said Harry, once he was sure Professor McGonagall was out earshot. “Snape's going through trapdoor tonight. He's found out everything he needs, and now he's got Dumbledore out way. He sent that note, I bet Ministry Magic will get real shock when Dumbledore turns up.”
   “But what can we—”
   Hermione gasped. Harry and Ron wheeled round.
   Snape was standing there.
   “Good afternoon,” he said smoothly.
   They stared him.
   “You shouldn't be inside day like this,” he said, an odd, twisted smile.
   “We were—” Harry began, without any idea what he was going say.
   “You want be more careful,” said Snape. “Hanging around like this, people will think you're up something. And Gryffindor really can't afford lose any more points, can it?”
   Harry flushed. They turned go outside, but Snape called them back.
   “Be warned, Potter—any more nighttime wanderings and I will personally make sure you are expelled. Good day you.”
   He strode off direction staffroom.
   Out stone steps, Harry turned others.
   “Right, here's what we've got do,” he whispered urgently. “One us has got keep an eye Snape—wait outside staff room and follow him if he leaves it. Hermione, you'd better do that.”
   “Why me?”
   “It's obvious,” said Ron. “You can pretend be waiting Professor Flitwick, you know.” He put high voice, “‘Oh Professor Flitwick, I'm so worried, I think I got question fourteen b wrong…'”
   “Oh, shut up,” said Hermione, but she agreed go and watch out Snape.
   “And we'd better stay outside third floor corridor,” Harry told Ron. “Come on.”
   But that part plan didn't work. No sooner had they reached door separating Fluffy rest school than Professor McGonagall turned up again and this time, she lost her temper.
   “I suppose you think you're harder get past than pack enchantments!” she stormed. “Enough this nonsense! If I hear you've come anywhere near here again, I'll take another fifty points Gryffindor! Yes, Weasley, my own house!”
   Harry and Ron went back common room, Harry had just said, “At least Hermione's Snape's tail,” when portrait Fat Lady swung open and Hermione came in.
   “I'm sorry, Harry!” she wailed. “Snape came out and asked me what I was doing, so I said I was waiting Flitwick, and Snape went get him, and I've only just got away, I don't know where Snape went.”
   “Well, that's it then, isn't it?” Harry said.
   other two stared him. He was pale and his eyes were glittering.
   “I'm going out here tonight and I'm going try and get Stone first.”
   “You're mad!” said Ron.
   “You can't!” said Hermione. “After what McGonagall and Snape have said? You'll be expelled!”
   “SO WHAT?” Harry shouted. “Don't you understand? If Snape gets hold Stone, Voldemort's coming back! Haven't you heard what it was like when he was trying take over? There won't be any Hogwarts get expelled from! He'll flatten it, or turn it school Dark Arts! Losing points doesn't matter anymore, can't you see? D'you think he'll leave you and your families alone if Gryffindor wins house cup? If I get caught before I can get Stone, well, I'll have go back Dursleys and wait Voldemort find me there, it's only dying bit later than I would have, because I'm never going over Dark Side! I'm going through that trapdoor tonight and nothing you two say is going stop me! Voldemort killed my parents, remember?”
   He glared them.
   “You're right, Harry,” said Hermione small voice.
   “I'll use Invisibility Cloak,” said Harry. “It's just lucky I got it back.”
   “But will it cover all three us?” said Ron.
   “All—all three us?”
   “Oh, come off it, you don't think we'd let you go alone?”
   “Of course not,” said Hermione briskly. “How do you think you'd get Stone without us? I'd better go and took through my books, there might be something useful…”
   “But if we get caught, you two will be expelled, too.”
   “Not if I can help it,” said Hermione grimly. “Flitwick told me secret that I got hundred and twelve percent his exam. They're not throwing me out after that.”
   After dinner three them sat nervously apart common room. Nobody bothered them; none Gryffindors had anything say Harry any more, after all. This was first night he hadn't been upset by it. Hermione was skimming through all her notes, hoping come across one enchantments they were try break. Harry and Ron didn't talk much. Both them were thinking what they were do.
   Slowly, room emptied people drifted off bed.
   “Better get cloak,” Ron muttered, Lee Jordan finally left, stretching and yawning. Harry ran upstairs their dark dormitory. He putted out cloak and then his eyes fell flute Hagrid had given him Christmas. He pocketed it use Fluffy—he didn't feel much like singing.
   He ran back down common room.
   “We'd better put cloak here, and make sure it covers all three us—if Filch spots one our feet wandering along its own—”
   “What are you doing?” said voice corner room. Neville appeared behind an armchair, clutching Trevor toad, who looked though he'd been making another bid freedom.
   “Nothing, Neville, nothing,” said Harry, hurriedly putting cloak behind his back.
   Neville stared their guilty faces.
   “You're going out again,” he said.
   “No, no, no,” said Hermione. “No, we're not. Why don't you go bed, Neville?”
   Harry looked grandfather clock by door. They couldn't afford waste any more time, Snape might even now be playing Fluffy sleep.
   “You can't go out,” said Neville, “you'll be caught again. Gryffindor will be even more trouble.”
   “You don't understand,” said Harry, “this is important.”
   But Neville was clearly steeling himself do something desperate.
   “I won't let you do it,” he said, hurrying stand front portrait hole. “I'll—I'll fight you!”
   “Neville,” Ron exploded, “get away that hole and don't be an idiot—”
   “Don't you call me an idiot!” said Neville. “I don't think you should be breaking any more rules! And you were one who told me stand up people!”
   “Yes, but not us,” said Ron exasperation. “Neville, you don't know what you're doing.”
   He took step forward and Neville dropped Trevor toad, who leapt out sight.
   “Go then, try and hit me!” said Neville, raising his fists. “I'm ready!”
   Harry turned Hermione.
   “Do something,” he said desperately.
   Hermione stepped forward.
   “Neville,” she said, “I'm really, really sorry this.”
   She raised her wand.
   “Petrificus Totalus!” she cried, pointing it Neville.
   Neville's arms snapped his sides. His legs sprang together. His whole body rigid, he swayed where he stood and then fell flat his face, stiff board.
   Hermione ran turn him over. Neville's jaws were jammed together so he couldn't speak. Only his eyes were moving, looking them horror.
   “What've you done him?” Harry whispered.
   “It's full Body Bind,” said Hermione miserably. “Oh, Neville, I'm so sorry.”
   “We had to, Neville, no time explain,” said Harry.
   “You'll understand later, Neville,” said Ron they stepped over him and pulled Invisibility Cloak.
   But leaving Neville lying motionless floor didn't feel like very good omen. their nervous state, every statue's shadow looked like Filch, every distant breath wind sounded like Peeves swooping down them. foot first set stairs, they spotted Mrs. Norris skulking near top.
   “Oh, let's kick her, just this once,” Ron whispered Harry's ear, but Harry shook his head. they climbed carefully around her, Mrs. Norris turned her lamplike eyes them, but didn't do anything.
   They didn't meet anyone else until they reached staircase up third floor. Peeves was bobbing halfway up, loosening carpet so that people would trip.
   “Who's there?” he said suddenly they climbed toward him. He narrowed his wicked black eyes. “Know you're there, even if I can't see you. Are you ghoulie or ghostie or wee student beastie?”
   He rose up air and floated there, squinting them.
   “Should call Filch, I should, if something's creeping around unseen.”
   Harry had sudden idea.
   “Peeves,” he said, hoarse whisper, “the Bloody Baron has his own reasons being invisible.”
   Peeves almost fell out air shock. He caught himself time and hovered foot off stairs.
   “So sorry, your bloodiness, Mr. Baron, Sir,” he said greasily. “My mistake, my mistake—I didn't see you—of course I didn't, you're invisible—forgive old Peevsie his little joke, sir.”
   “I have business here, Peeves,” croaked Harry. “Stay away this place tonight.”
   “I will, sir, I most certainly will,” said Peeves, rising up air again. “Hope your business goes well, Baron, I'll not bother you.”
   And he scooted off.
   “Brilliant, Harry!” whispered Ron.
   few seconds later, they were there, outside third floor corridor—and door was already ajar.
   “Well, there you are,” Harry said quietly, “Snape's already got past Fluffy.”
   Seeing open door somehow seemed impress upon all three them what was facing them. Underneath cloak, Harry turned other two.
   “If you want go back, I won't blame you,” he said. “You can take cloak, I won't need it now.”
   “Don't be stupid,” said Ron.
   “We're coming,” said Hermione.
   Harry pushed door open.
   door creaked, low, rumbling growls met their ears. All three dog's noses sniffed madly their direction, even though it couldn't see them.
   “What's that its feet?” Hermione whispered.
   “Looks like harp,” said Ron. “Snape must have left it there.”
   “It must wake up moment you stop playing,” said Harry. “Well, here goes…”
   He put Hagrid's flute his lips and blew. It wasn't really tune, but first note beast's eyes began droop. Harry hardly drew breath. Slowly, dog's growls ceased—it tottered its paws and fell its knees, then it slumped ground, fast asleep.
   “Keep playing,” Ron warned Harry they slipped out cloak and crept toward trapdoor. They could feel dog's hot, smelly breath they approached giant heads. “I think we'll be able pull door open,” said Ron, peering over dog's back. “Want go first, Hermione?”
   “No, I don't!”
   “All right.” Ron gritted his teeth and stepped carefully over dog's legs. He bent and pulled ring trapdoor, which swung up and open.
   “What can you see?” Hermione said anxiously.
   “Nothing—just black—there's no way climbing down, we'll just have drop.”
   Harry, who was still playing flute, waved Ron get his attention and pointed himself.
   “You want go first? Are you sure?” said Ron. “I don't know how deep this thing goes. Give flute Hermione so she can keep him asleep.”
   Harry handed flute over. few seconds' silence, dog growled and twitched, but moment Hermione began play, it fell back its deep sleep.
   Harry climbed over it and looked down through trapdoor. There was no sign bottom.
   He lowered himself through hole until he was hanging by his fingertips. Then he looked up Ron and said, “If anything happens me, don't follow. Go straight owlery and send Hedwig Dumbledore, right?”
   “Right,” said Ron.
   “See you minute, I hope…”
   And Harry let go. Cold, damp air rushed past him he fell down, down, down and—
   FLUMP. funny, muffled sort thump he landed something soft. He sat up and felt around, his eyes not used gloom. It felt though he was sitting some sort plant.
   “It's okay!” he called up light size postage stamp, which was open trapdoor, “it's soft landing, you can jump!”
   Ron followed right away. He landed, sprawled next Harry.
   “What's this stuff?” were his first words.
   “Dunno, some sort plant thing. I suppose it's here break fall. Come on, Hermione!”
   distant music stopped. There was loud bark dog, but Hermione had already jumped. She landed Harry's other side.
   “We must be miles under school,” she said.
   “Lucky this plant thing's here, really,” said Ron.
   “Lucky!” shrieked Hermione. “Look you both!”
   She leapt up and struggled toward damp wall. She had struggle because moment she had landed, plant had started twist snakelike tendrils around her ankles. Harry and Ron, their legs had already been bound tightly long creepers without their noticing.
   Hermione had managed free herself before plant got firm grip her. Now she watched horror two boys fought pull plant off them, but more they strained against it, tighter and faster plant wound around them.
   “Stop moving!” Hermione ordered them. “I know what this is—it's Devil's Snare!”
   “Oh, I'm so glad we know what it's called, that's great help,” snarled Ron, leaning back, trying stop plant curling around his neck. “Shut up, I'm trying remember how kill it!” said Hermione.
   “Well, hurry up, I can't breathe!” Harry gasped, wrestling it it curled around his chest.
   “Devil's Snare, Devil's Snare… what did Professor Sprout say?—it likes dark and damp—”
   “So light fire!” Harry choked.
   “Yes—of course—but there's no wood!” Hermione cried, wringing her hands.
   “HAVE YOU GONE MAD?” Ron bellowed. “ARE YOU WITCH OR NOT?”
   “Oh, right!” said Hermione, and she whipped out her wand, waved it, muttered something, and sent jet same bluebell flames she had used Snape plant. matter seconds, two boys felt it loosening its grip it cringed away light and warmth. Wriggling and flailing, it unraveled itself their bodies, and they were able pull free.
   “Lucky you pay attention Herbology, Hermione,” said Harry he joined her by wall, wiping sweat off his face.
   “Yeah,” said Ron, “and lucky Harry doesn't lose his head crisis—‘there's no wood,' honestly.”
   “This way,” said Harry, pointing down stone passageway, which was only way forward.
   All they could hear apart their footsteps was gentle drip water trickling down walls. passageway sloped downward, and Harry was reminded Gringotts. an unpleasant jolt heart, he remembered dragons said be guarding vaults wizards' bank. If they met dragon, fully grown dragon—Norbert had been bad enough…
   “Can you hear something?” Ron whispered.
   Harry listened. soft rustling and clinking seemed be coming up ahead.
   “Do you think it's ghost?”
   “I don't know… sounds like wings me.”
   “There's light ahead—I can see something moving.”
   They reached end passageway and saw before them brilliantly lit chamber, its ceiling arching high above them. It was full small, jewel bright birds, fluttering and tumbling all around room. opposite side chamber was heavy wooden door.
   “Do you think they'll attack us if we cross room?” said Ron.
   “Probably,” said Harry. “They don't look very vicious, but I suppose if they all swooped down once… well, there's no other choice… I'll run.”
   He took deep breath, covered his face his arms, and sprinted across room. He expected feel sharp beaks and claws tearing him any second, but nothing happened. He reached door untouched. He pulled handle, but it was locked.
   other two followed him. They tugged and heaved door, but it wouldn't budge, not even when Hermione tried her Alohomora charm.
   “Now what?” said Ron.
   “These birds… they can't be here just decoration,” said Hermione.
   They watched birds soaring overhead, glittering—glittering?
   “They're not birds!” Harry said suddenly. “They're keys! Winged keys—look carefully. So that must mean…” he looked around chamber while other two squinted up flock keys. “…yes—look! Broomsticks! We've got catch key door!”
   “But there are hundreds them!”
   Ron examined lock door.
   “We're looking big, old fashioned one—probably silver, like handle.”
   They each seized broomstick and kicked off air, soaring midst cloud keys. They grabbed and snatched, but bewitched keys darted and dived so quickly it was almost impossible catch one.
   Not nothing, though, was Harry youngest Seeker century. He had knack spotting things other people didn't. After minute's weaving through whirl rainbow feathers, he noticed large silver key that had bent wing, if it had already been caught and stuffed roughly keyhole.
   “That one!” he called others. “That big one—there—no, there—with bright blue wings—the feathers are all crumpled one side.”
   Ron went speeding direction that Harry was pointing, crashed ceiling, and nearly fell off his broom.
   “We've got close it!” Harry called, not taking his eyes off key damaged wing. “Ron, you come it above—Hermione, stay below and stop it going down and I'll try and catch it. Right, NOW!”
   Ron dived, Hermione rocketed upward, key dodged them both, and Harry streaked after it; it sped toward wall, Harry leaned forward and nasty, crunching noise, pinned it against stone one hand. Ron and Hermione's cheers echoed around high chamber.
   They landed quickly, and Harry ran door, key struggling his hand. He rammed it lock and turned—it worked. moment lock had clicked open, key took flight again, looking very battered now that it had been caught twice.
   “Ready?” Harry asked other two, his hand door handle. They nodded. He pulled door open.
   next chamber was so dark they couldn't see anything all. But they stepped it, light suddenly flooded room reveal an astonishing sight.
   They were standing edge huge chessboard, behind black chessmen, which were all taller than they were and carved what looked like black stone. Facing them, way across chamber, were white pieces. Harry, Ron and Hermione shivered slightly—the towering white chessmen had no faces.
   “Now what do we do?” Harry whispered.
   “It's obvious, isn't it?” said Ron. “We've got play our way across room.”
   Behind white pieces they could see another door.
   “How?” said Hermione nervously.
   “I think,” said Ron, “we're going have be chessmen.”
   He walked up black knight and put his hand out touch knight's horse. once, stone sprang life. horse pawed ground and knight turned his helmeted head look down Ron.
   “Do we—er—have join you get across?” black knight nodded. Ron turned other two.
   “This needs thinking he said. I suppose we've got take place three black pieces…”
   Harry and Hermione stayed quiet, watching Ron think. Finally he said, “Now, don't be offended or anything, but neither you are that good chess—”
   “We're not offended,” said Harry quickly. “Just tell us what do.”
   “Well, Harry, you take place that bishop, and Hermione, you go next him instead that castle.”
   “What you?”
   “I'm going be knight,” said Ron.
   chessmen seemed have been listening, because these words knight, bishop, and castle turned their backs white pieces and walked off board, leaving three empty squares that Harry, Ron, and Hermione took.
   “White always plays first chess,” said Ron, peering across board. “Yes… look…”
   white pawn had moved forward two squares.
   Ron started direct black pieces. They moved silently wherever he sent them. Harry's knees were trembling. What if they lost?
   “Harry—move diagonally four squares right.”
   Their first real shock came when their other knight was taken. white queen smashed him floor and dragged him off board, where he lay quite still, facedown.
   “Had let that happen,” said Ron, looking shaken. “Leaves you free take that bishop, Hermione, go on.”
   Every time one their men was lost, white pieces showed no mercy. Soon there was huddle limp black players slumped along wall. Twice, Ron only just noticed time that Harry and Hermione were danger. He himself darted around board, taking almost many white pieces they had lost black ones.
   “We're nearly there,” he muttered suddenly. “Let me think—let me think…”
   white queen turned her blank face toward him.
   “Yes…” said Ron softly, “It's only way… I've got be taken.”
   “NO!” Harry and Hermione shouted.
   “That's chess!” snapped Ron. “You've got make some sacrifices! I take one step forward and she'll take me—that leaves you free checkmate king, Harry!”
   “But—”
   “Do you want stop Snape or not?”
   “Ron—”
   “Look, if you don't hurry up, he'll already have Stone!”
   There was no alternative.
   “Ready?” Ron called, his face pale but determined. “Here I go—now, don't hang around once you've won.”
   He stepped forward, and white queen pounced. She struck Ron hard across head her stone arm, and he crashed floor—Hermione screamed but stayed her square—the white queen dragged Ron one side. He looked if he'd been knocked out.
   Shaking, Harry moved three spaces left.
   white king took off his crown and threw it Harry's feet. They had won. chessmen parted and bowed, leaving door ahead clear. one last desperate look back Ron, Harry and Hermione charged through door and up next passageway.
   “What if he's—?”
   “He'll be all right,” said Harry, trying convince himself. “What do you reckon's next?”
   “We've had Sprout's, that was Devil's Snare; Flitwick must've put charms keys; McGonagall transfigured chessmen make them alive; that leaves Quirrell's spell, and Snape's.”
   They had reached another door.
   “All right?” Harry whispered.
   “Go on.”
   Harry pushed it open.
   disgusting smell filled their nostrils, making both them pull their robes up over their noses. Eyes watering, they saw, flat floor front them, troll even larger than one they had tackled, out cold bloody lump its head.
   “I'm glad we didn't have fight that one,” Harry whispered they stepped carefully over one its massive legs. “Come on, I can't breathe.”
   He pulled open next door, both them hardly daring look what came next—but there was nothing very frightening here, just table seven differently shaped bottles standing it line.
   “Snape's,” said Harry. “What do we have do?”
   They stepped over threshold, and immediately fire sprang up behind them doorway. It wasn't ordinary fire either; it was purple. same instant, black flames shot up doorway leading onward. They were trapped.
   “Look!” Hermione seized roll paper lying next bottles. Harry looked over her shoulder read it:
   
    
     Danger lies before you, while safety lies behind,

     Two us will help you, which ever you would find,

     One among us seven will let you move ahead,

     Another will transport drinker back instead,

    

    
     Two among our number hold only nettle wine,

     Three us are killers, waiting bidden line.

     Choose, unless you wish stay here forevermore,

     help you your choice, we give you these clues four:

    

    
     First, however slyly poison tries hide

     You will always find some nettle wine's left side;

     Second, different are those who stand either end,

     But if you would move onward, neither is your friend;

    

    
     Third, you see clearly, all are different size,

     Neither dwarf nor giant holds death their insides;

     Fourth, second left and second right

     Are twins once you taste them, though different first sight.

    

   
   Hermione let out great sigh and Harry, amazed, saw that she was smiling, very last thing he felt like doing.
   “Brilliant,” said Hermione. “This isn't magic—it's logic—a puzzle. lot greatest wizards haven't got an ounce logic, they'd be stuck here forever.”
   “But so will we, won't we?”
   “Of course not,” said Hermione. “Everything we need is here this paper. Seven bottles: three are poison; two are wine; one will get us safely through black fire, and one will get us back through purple.”
   “But how do we know which drink?”
   “Give me minute.”
   Hermione read paper several times. Then she walked up and down line bottles, muttering herself and pointing them. last, she clapped her hands.
   “Got it,” she said. “The smallest bottle will get us through black fire—toward Stone.”
   Harry looked tiny bottle.
   “There's only enough there one us,” he said. “That's hardly one swallow.”
   They looked each other.
   “Which one will get you back through purple flames?”
   Hermione pointed rounded bottle right end line.
   “You drink that,” said Harry. “No, listen, get back and get Ron. Grab brooms flying-key room, they'll get you out trapdoor and past Fluffy—go straight owlery and send Hedwig Dumbledore, we need him. I might be able hold Snape off while, but I'm no match him, really.”
   “But Harry—what if You-Know-Who's him?”
   “Well—I was lucky once, wasn't I?” said Harry, pointing his scar. “I might get lucky again.”
   Hermione's lip trembled, and she suddenly dashed Harry and threw her arms around him.
   “Hermione!”
   “Harry—you're great wizard, you know.”
   “I'm not good you,” said Harry, very embarrassed, she let go him.
   “Me!” said Hermione. “Books! And cleverness! There are more important things—friendship and bravery and—oh Harry—be careful!”
   “You drink first,” said Harry. “You are sure which is which, aren't you?”
   “Positive,” said Hermione. She took long drink round bottle end, and shuddered.
   “It's not poison?” said Harry anxiously.
   “No—but it's like ice.”
   “Quick, go, before it wears off.”
   “Good luck—take care.”
   “GO!”
   Hermione turned and walked straight through purple fire.
   Harry took deep breath and picked up smallest bottle. He turned face black flames.
   “Here I come,” he said, and he drained little bottle one gulp.
   It was indeed though ice was flooding his body. He put bottle down and walked forward; he braced himself, saw black flames licking his body, but couldn't feel them—for moment he could see nothing but dark fire—then he was other side, last chamber.
   There was already someone there—but it wasn't Snape. It wasn't even Voldemort.
  

  

   

    17. MAN TWO FACES
   

   It was Quirrell.
   “You!” gasped Harry.
   Quirrell smiled. His face wasn't twitching all.
   “Me,” he said calmly. “I wondered whether I'd be meeting you here, Potter.”
   “But I thought—Snape—”
   “Severus?” Quirrell laughed, and it wasn't his usual quivering treble, either, but cold and sharp. “Yes, Severus does seem type, doesn't he? So useful have him swooping around like an overgrown bat. Next him, who would suspect p-p-poor, st-stuttering P-Professor Quirrell?”
   Harry couldn't take it in. This couldn't be true, it couldn't.
   “But Snape tried kill me!”
   “No, no, no. I tried kill you. Your friend Miss Granger accidentally knocked me over she rushed set fire Snape that Quidditch match. She broke my eye contact you. Another few seconds and I'd have got you off that broom. I'd have managed it before then if Snape hadn't been muttering countercurse, trying save you.”
   “Snape was trying save me?”
   “Of course,” said Quirrell coolly. “Why do you think he wanted referee your next match? He was trying make sure I didn't do it again. Funny, really… he needn't have bothered. I couldn't do anything Dumbledore watching. All other teachers thought Snape was trying stop Gryffindor winning, he did make himself unpopular… and what waste time, when after all that, I'm going kill you tonight.”
   Quirrell snapped his fingers. Ropes sprang out thin air and wrapped themselves tightly around Harry.
   “You're too nosy live, Potter. Scurrying around school Halloween like that, all I knew you'd seen me coming look what was guarding Stone.”
   “You let troll in?”
   “Certainly. I have special gift trolls—you must have seen what I did one chamber back there? Unfortunately, while everyone else was running around looking it, Snape, who already suspected me, went straight third floor head me off—and not only did my troll fail beat you death, that three headed dog didn't even manage bite Snape's leg off properly.
   “Now, wait quietly, Potter. I need examine this interesting mirror.”
   It was only then that Harry realized what was standing behind Quirrell. It was Mirror Erised.
   “This mirror is key finding Stone,” Quirrell murmured, tapping his way around frame. “Trust Dumbledore come up something like this… but he's London… I'll be far away by time he gets back…”
   All Harry could think doing was keep Quirrell talking and stop him concentrating mirror.
   “I saw you and Snape forest—” he blurted out.
   “Yes,” said Quirrell idly, walking around mirror look back. “He was me by that time, trying find out how far I'd got. He suspected me all along. Tried frighten me—as though he could, when I had Lord Voldemort my side…”
   Quirrell came back out behind mirror and stared hungrily it.
   “I see Stone… I'm presenting it my master… but where is it?”
   Harry struggled against ropes binding him, but they didn't give. He had keep Quirrell giving his whole attention mirror.
   “But Snape always seemed hate me so much.”
   “Oh, he does,” said Quirrell casually, “heavens, yes. He was Hogwarts your father, didn't you know? They loathed each other. But he never wanted you dead.”
   “But I heard you few days ago, sobbing—I thought Snape was threatening you…”
   first time, spasm fear flitted across Quirrell's face.
   “Sometimes,” he said, “I find it hard follow my master's instructions—he is great wizard and I am weak—”
   “You mean he was there classroom you?” Harry gasped.
   “He is me wherever I go,” said Quirrell quietly. “I met him when I traveled around world. foolish young man I was then, full ridiculous ideas good and evil. Lord Voldemort showed me how wrong I was. There is no good and evil, there is only power, and those too weak seek it… Since then, I have served him faithfully, although I have let him down many times. He has had be very hard me.” Quirrell shivered suddenly. “He does not forgive mistakes easily. When I failed steal stone Gringotts, he was most displeased. He punished me… decided he would have keep closer watch me…”
   Quirrell's voice trailed away. Harry was remembering his trip Diagon Alley how could he have been so stupid? He'd seen Quirrell there that very day, shaken hands him Leaky Cauldron.
   Quirrell cursed under his breath.
   “I don't understand… is Stone inside mirror? Should I break it?”
   Harry's mind was racing.
   What I want more than anything else world moment, he thought, is find Stone before Quirrell does. So if I look mirror, I should see myseff finding it—which means I'll see where it's hidden! But how can I look without Quirrell realizing what I'm up to?
   He tried edge left, get front glass without Quirrell noticing, but ropes around his ankles were too tight: he tripped and fell over. Quirrell ignored him. He was still talking himself.
   “What does this mirror do? How does it work? Help me, Master!”
   And Harry's horror, voice answered, and voice seemed come Quirrell himself.
   “Use boy… Use boy…”
   Quirrell rounded Harry.
   “Yes—Potter—come here.”
   He clapped his hands once, and ropes binding Harry fell off. Harry got slowly his feet.
   “Come here,” Quirrell repeated. “Look mirror and tell me what you see.”
   Harry walked toward him.
   I must lie, he thought desperately.I must look and lie what I see, that's all.
   Quirrell moved close behind him. Harry breathed funny smell that seemed come Quirrell's turban. He closed his eyes, stepped front mirror, and opened them again.
   He saw his reflection, pale and scared looking first. But moment later, reflection smiled him. It put its hand its pocket and pulled out blood red stone. It winked and put Stone back its pocket—and it did so, Harry felt something heavy drop his real pocket. Somehow—incredibly—he'd gotten Stone.
   “Well?” said Quirrell impatiently. “What do you see?”
   Harry screwed up his courage.
   “I see myself shaking hands Dumbledore,” he invented. “I—I've won house cup Gryffindor.”
   Quirrell cursed again.
   “Get out way,” he said. Harry moved aside, he felt Sorcerer's Stone against his leg. Dare he make break it?
   But he hadn't walked five paces before high voice spoke, though Quirrell wasn't moving his lips.
   “He lies… He lies…”
   “Potter, come back here!” Quirrell shouted. “Tell me truth! What did you just see?”
   high voice spoke again.
   “Let me speak him… face-to-face…”
   “Master, you are not strong enough!”
   “I have strength enough… this…”
   Harry felt if Devil's Snare was rooting him spot. He couldn't move muscle. Petrified, he watched Quirrell reached up and began unwrap his turban. What was going on? turban fell away. Quirrell's head looked strangely small without it. Then he turned slowly spot.
   Harry would have screamed, but he couldn't make sound. Where there should have been back Quirrell's head, there was face, most terrible face Harry had ever seen. It was chalk white glaring red eyes and slits nostrils, like snake.
   “Harry Potter…” it whispered.
   Harry tried take step backward but his legs wouldn't move.
   “See what I have become?” face said. “Mere shadow and vapor… I have form only when I can share another's body… but there have always been those willing let me their hearts and minds… Unicorn blood has strengthened me, these past weeks… you saw faithful Quirrell drinking it me forest… and once I have Elixir Life, I will be able create body my own… Now… why don't you give me that Stone your pocket?”
   So he knew. feeling suddenly surged back Harry's legs. He stumbled backward.
   “Don't be fool,” snarled face. “Better save your own life and join me… or you'll meet same end your parents… They died begging me mercy…”
   “LIAR!” Harry shouted suddenly.
   Quirrell was walking backward him, so that Voldemort could still see him. evil face was now smiling.
   “How touching…” it hissed. “I always value bravery… Yes, boy, your parents were brave… I killed your father first; and he put up courageous fight… but your mother needn't have died… she was trying protect you… Now give me Stone, unless you want her have died vain.”
   “NEVER!”
   Harry sprang toward flame door, but Voldemort screamed “SEIZE HIM!” and next second, Harry felt Quirrell's hand close his wrist. once, needle sharp pain seared across Harry's scar; his head felt though it was split two; he yelled, struggling all his might, and his surprise, Quirrell let go him. pain his head lessened—he looked around wildly see where Quirrell had gone, and saw him hunched pain, looking his fingers—they were blistering before his eyes.
   “Seize him! SEIZE HIM!” shrieked Voldemort again, and Quirrell lunged, knocking Harry clean off his feet, landing top him, both hands around Harry's neck—Harry's scar was almost blinding him pain, yet he could see Quirrell howling agony.
   “Master, I cannot hold him—my hands—my hands!”
   And Quirrell, though pinning Harry ground his knees, let go his neck and stared, bewildered, his own palms—Harry could see they looked burned, raw, red, and shiny.
   “Then kill him, fool, and be done!” screeched Voldemort.
   Quirrell raised his hand perform deadly curse, but Harry, by instinct, reached up and grabbed Quirrell's face—
   “AAAARGH!”
   Quirrell rolled off him, his face blistering, too, and then Harry knew: Quirrell couldn't touch his bare skin, not without suffering terrible pain—his only chance was keep hold Quirrell, keep him enough pain stop him doing curse.
   Harry jumped his feet, caught Quirrell by arm, and hung tight he could. Quirrell screamed and tried throw Harry off—the pain Harry's head was building—he couldn't see—he could only hear Quirrell's terrible shrieks and Voldemort's yells of, “KILL HIM! KILL HIM!” and other voices, maybe Harry's own head, crying, “Harry! Harry!”
   He felt Quirrell's arm wrenched his grasp, knew all was lost, and fell blackness, down… down… down…
   Something gold was glinting just above him. Snitch! He tried catch it, but his arms were too heavy.
   He blinked. It wasn't Snitch all. It was pair glasses. How strange.
   He blinked again. smiling face Albus Dumbledore swam view above him.
   “Good afternoon, Harry,” said Dumbledore. Harry stared him. Then he remembered: “Sir! Stone! It was Quirrell! He's got Stone! Sir, quick—”
   “Calm yourself, dear boy, you are little behind times,” said Dumbledore. “Quirrell does not have Stone.”
   “Then who does? Sir, I—”
   “Harry, please relax, or Madam Pomfrey will have me thrown out.”
   Harry swallowed and looked around him. He realized he must be hospital wing. He was lying bed white linen sheets, and next him was table piled high what looked like half candy shop.
   “Tokens your friends and admirers,” said Dumbledore, beaming. “What happened down dungeons between you and Professor Quirrell is complete secret, so, naturally, whole school knows. I believe your friends Misters Fred and George Weasley were responsible trying send you toilet seat. No doubt they thought it would amuse you. Madam Pomfrey, however, felt it might not be very hygienic, and confiscated it.”
   “How long have I been here?”
   “Three days. Mr. Ronald Weasley and Miss Granger will be most relieved you have come round, they have been extremely worried.”
   “But sit, Stone—”
   “I see you are not be distracted. Very well, Stone. Professor Quirrell did not manage take it you. I arrived time prevent that, although you were doing very well your own, I must say.”
   “You got there? You got Hermione's owl?”
   “We must have crossed midair. No sooner had I reached London than it became clear me that place I should be was one I had just left. I arrived just time pull Quirrell off you.”
   “It was you.”
   “I feared I might be too late.”
   “You nearly were, I couldn't have kept him off Stone much longer—”
   “Not Stone, boy, you—the effort involved nearly killed you. one terrible moment there, I was afraid it had. Stone, it has been destroyed.”
   “Destroyed?” said Harry blankly. “But your friend—Nicolas Flamel—”
   “Oh, you know Nicolas?” said Dumbledore, sounding quite delighted. “You did do thing properly, didn't you? Well, Nicolas and I have had little chat, and agreed it's all best.”
   “But that means he and his wife will die, won't they?”
   “They have enough Elixir stored set their affairs order and then, yes, they will die.”
   Dumbledore smiled look amazement Harry's face.
   “To one young you, I'm sure it seems incredible, but Nicolas and Perenelle, it really is like going bed after very, very long day. After all, well organized mind, death is but next great adventure. You know, Stone was really not such wonderful thing. much money and life you could want! two things most human beings would choose above all—the trouble is, humans do have knack choosing precisely those things that are worst them.”
   Harry lay there, lost words. Dumbledore hummed little and smiled ceiling.
   “Sir?” said Harry. “I've been thinking… sir—even if Stone's gone, Vol—, I mean, You-Know-Who—”
   “Call him Voldemort, Harry. Always use proper name things. Fear name increases fear thing itself.”
   “Yes, sir. Well, Voldemort's going try other ways coming back, isn't he? I mean, he hasn't gone, has he?”
   “No, Harry, he has not. He is still out there somewhere, perhaps looking another body share… not being truly alive, he cannot be killed. He left Quirrell die; he shows just little mercy his followers his enemies. Nevertheless, Harry, while you may only have delayed his return power, it will merely take someone else who is prepared fight what seems losing battle next time—and if he is delayed again, and again, why, he may never return power.”
   Harry nodded, but stopped quickly, because it made his head hurt. Then he said, “Sir, there are some other things I'd like know, if you can tell me… things I want know truth about…”
   “The truth.” Dumbledore sighed. “It is beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated great caution. However, I shall answer your questions unless I have very good reason not to, which case I beg you'll forgive me. I shall not, course, lie.”
   “Well… Voldemort said that he only killed my mother because she tried stop him killing me. But why would he want kill me first place?”
   Dumbledore sighed very deeply this time.
   “Alas, first thing you ask me, I cannot tell you. Not today. Not now. You will know, one day… put it your mind now, Harry. When you are older… I know you hate hear this… when you are ready, you will know.”
   And Harry knew it would be no good argue.
   “But why couldn't Quirrell touch me?”
   “Your mother died save you. If there is one thing Voldemort cannot understand, it is love. He didn't realize that love powerful your mother's you leaves its own mark. Not scar, no visible sign… have been loved so deeply, even though person who loved us is gone, will give us some protection forever. It is your very skin. Quirrell, full hatred, greed, and ambition, sharing his soul Voldemort, could not touch you this reason. It was agony touch person marked by something so good.”
   Dumbledore now became very interested bird out windowsill, which gave Harry time dry his eyes sheet. When he had found his voice again, Harry said, “And Invisibility Cloak—do you know who sent it me?”
   “Ah—your father happened leave it my possession, and I thought you might like it.” Dumbledore's eyes twinkled. “Useful things… your father used it mainly sneaking off kitchens steal food when he was here.”
   “And there's something else…”
   “Fire away.”
   “Quirrell said Snape—”
   “Professor Snape, Harry.”
   “Yes, him—Quirrell said he hates me because he hated my father. Is that true?”
   “Well, they did rather detest each other. Not unlike yourself and Mr. Malfoy. And then, your father did something Snape could never forgive.”
   “What?”
   “He saved his life.”
   “What?”
   “Yes…” said Dumbledore dreamily. “Funny, way people's minds work, isn't it? Professor Snape couldn't bear being your father's debt… I do believe he worked so hard protect you this year because he felt that would make him and your father even. Then he could go back hating your father's memory peace…”
   Harry tried understand this but it made his head pound, so he stopped.
   “And sir, there's one more thing…”
   “Just one?”
   “How did I get Stone out mirror?”
   “Ah, now, I'm glad you asked me that. It was one my more brilliant ideas, and between you and me, that's saying something. You see, only one who wanted find Stone—find it, but not use it—would be able get it, otherwise they'd just see themselves making gold or drinking Elixir Life. My brain surprises even me sometimes… Now, enough questions. I suggest you make start these sweets. Ah! Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans! I was unfortunate enough my youth come across vomitflavored one, and since then I'm afraid I've rather lost my liking them—but I think I'll be safe nice toffee, don't you?”
   He smiled and popped golden brown bean his mouth. Then he choked and said, “Alas! Ear wax!”
   Madam Pomfrey, nurse, was nice woman, but very strict.
   “Just five minutes,” Harry pleaded.
   “Absolutely not.”
   “You let Professor Dumbledore in…”
   “Well, course, that was headmaster, quite different. You need rest.”
   “I am resting, look, lying down and everything. Oh, go on, Madam Pomfrey…”
   “Oh, very well,” she said. “But five minutes only.”
   And she let Ron and Hermione in.
   “Harry!”
   Hermione looked ready fling her arms around him again, but Harry was glad she held herself his head was still very sore.
   “Oh, Harry, we were sure you were going to—Dumbledore was so worried—”
   “The whole school's talking it,” said Ron. “What really happened?”
   It was one those rare occasions when true story is even more strange and exciting than wild rumors. Harry told them everything: Quirrell; mirror; Stone; and Voldemort. Ron and Hermione were very good audience; they gasped all right places, and when Harry told them what was under Quirrell's turban, Hermione screamed out loud.
   “So Stone's gone?” said Ron finally. “Flamel's just going die?”
   “That's what I said, but Dumbledore thinks that—what was it?—‘to well organized mind, death is but next great adventure.'”
   “I always said he was off his rocker,” said Ron, looking quite impressed how crazy his hero was.
   “So what happened you two?” said Harry.
   “Well, I got back all right,” said Hermione. “I brought Ron round—that took while—and we were dashing up owlery contact Dumbledore when we met him entrance hall—he already knew—he just said, ‘Harry's gone after him, hasn't he?' and hurtled off third floor.”
   “D'you think he meant you do it?” said Ron. “Sending you your father's cloak and everything?”
   “Well,” Hermione exploded, “if he did—I mean say that's terrible—you could have been killed.”
   “No, it isn't,” said Harry thoughtfully. “He's funny man, Dumbledore. I think he sort wanted give me chance. I think he knows more or less everything that goes here, you know. I reckon he had pretty good idea we were going try, and instead stopping us, he just taught us enough help. I don't think it was an accident he let me find out how mirror worked. It's almost like he thought I had right face Voldemort if I could…”
   “Yeah, Dumbledore's off his rocker, all right,” said Ron proudly. “Listen, you've got be up end year feast tomorrow. points are all and Slytherin won, course—you missed last Quidditch match, we were steamrollered by Ravenclaw without you—but food'll be good.”
   that moment, Madam Pomfrey bustled over.
   “You've had nearly fifteen minutes, now OUT,” she said firmly.
   After good night's sleep, Harry felt nearly back normal.
   “I want go feast,” he told Madam Pomfrey she straightened his many candy boxes. I can, can't I?”
   “Professor Dumbledore says you are be allowed go,” she said stiffily, though her opinion Professor Dumbledore didn't realize how risky feasts could be. “And you have another visitor.”
   “Oh, good,” said Harry. “Who is it?”
   Hagrid sidled through door he spoke. usual when he was indoors, Hagrid looked too big be allowed. He sat down next Harry, took one look him, and burst tears.
   “It's—all—my—ruddy—fault!” he sobbed, his face his hands. “I told evil git how ter get past Fluffy! I told him! It was only thing he didn't know, an' I told him! Yeh could've died! All fer dragon egg! I'll never drink again! I should be chucked out an' made ter live Muggle!”
   “Hagrid!” said Harry, shocked see Hagrid shaking grief and remorse, great tears leaking down his beard. “Hagrid, he'd have found out somehow, this is Voldemort we're talking about, he'd have found out even if you hadn't told him.”
   “Yeh could've died!” sobbed Hagrid. “An' don' say name!”
   “VOLDEMORT!” Harry bellowed, and Hagrid was so shocked, he stopped crying. “I've met him and I'm calling him by his name. Please cheer up, Hagrid, we saved Stone, it's gone, he can't use it. Have Chocolate Frog, I've got loads…”
   Hagrid wiped his nose back his hand and said, “That reminds me. I've got yeh present.”
   “It's not stoat sandwich, is it?” said Harry anxiously, and last Hagrid gave weak chuckle.
   “Nah. Dumbledore gave me day off yesterday ter fix it. 'Course, he shoulda sacked me instead—anyway, got yeh this…”
   It seemed be handsome, leather covered book. Harry opened it curiously. It was full wizard photographs. Smiling and waving him every page were his mother and father.
   “Sent owls off ter all yer parents' old school friends, askin' fer photos… knew yeh didn' have any… d'yeh like it?”
   Harry couldn't speak, but Hagrid understood.
   Harry made his way down end year feast alone that night. He had been held up by Madam Pomfrey's fussing about, insisting giving him one last checkup, so Great Hall was already full. It was decked out Slytherin colors green and silver celebrate Slytherin's winning house cup seventh year row. huge banner showing Slytherin serpent covered wall behind High Table.
   When Harry walked there was sudden hush, and then everybody started talking loudly once. He slipped seat between Ron and Hermione Gryffindor table and tried ignore fact that people were standing up look him.
   Fortunately, Dumbledore arrived moments later. babble died away.
   “Another year gone!” Dumbledore said cheerfully. “And I must trouble you an old man's wheezing waffle before we sink our teeth our delicious feast. What year it has been! Hopefully your heads are all little fuller than they were… you have whole summer ahead get them nice and empty before next year starts…
   “Now, I understand it, house cup here needs awarding, and points stand thus: fourth place, Gryffindor, three hundred and twelve points; third, Hufflepuff, three hundred and fifty two; Ravenclaw has four hundred and twenty six and Slytherin, four hundred and seventy-two.”
   storm cheering and stamping broke out Slytherin table. Harry could see Draco Malfoy banging his goblet table. It was sickening sight.
   “Yes, yes, well done, Slytherin,” said Dumbledore. “However, recent events must be taken account.”
   room went very still. Slytherins' smiles faded little.
   “Ahem,” said Dumbledore. “I have few last minute points dish out. Let me see. Yes…
   “First—to Mr. Ronald Weasley…”
   Ron went purple face; he looked like radish bad sunburn.
   “…for best played game chess Hogwarts has seen many years, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”
   Gryffindor cheers nearly raised bewitched ceiling; stars overhead seemed quiver. Percy could be heard telling other prefects, “My brother, you know! My youngest brother! Got past McGonagall's giant chess set!”
   last there was silence again.
   “Second—to Miss Hermione Granger… use cool logic face fire, I award Gryffindor house fifty points.”
   Hermione buried her face her arms; Harry strongly suspected she had burst tears. Gryffindors up and down table were beside themselves—they were hundred points up.
   “Third—to Mr. Harry Potter…” said Dumbledore. room went deadly quiet “…for pure nerve and outstanding courage, I award Gryffindor house sixty points.”
   din was deafening. Those who could add up while yelling themselves hoarse knew that Gryffindor now had four hundred and seventy two points—exactly same Slytherin. They had tied house cup—if only Dumbledore had given Harry just one more point.
   Dumbledore raised his hand. room gradually fell silent.
   “There are all kinds courage,” said Dumbledore, smiling. “It takes great deal bravery stand up our enemies, but just much stand up our friends. I therefore award ten points Mr. Neville Longbottom.”
   Someone standing outside Great Hall might well have thought some sort explosion had taken place, so loud was noise that erupted Gryffindor table. Harry, Ron, and Hermione stood up yell and cheer Neville, white shock, disappeared under pile people hugging him. He had never won so much point Gryffindor before. Harry, still cheering, nudged Ron ribs and pointed Malfoy, who couldn't have looked more stunned and horrified if he'd just had Body Bind Curse put him.
   “Which means,” Dumbledore called over storm applause, even Ravenclaw and Hufflepuff were celebrating downfall Slytherin, “we need little change decoration.”
   He clapped his hands. an instant, green hangings became scarlet and silver became gold; huge Slytherin serpent vanished and towering Gryffindor lion took its place. Snape was shaking Professor McGonagall's hand, horrible, forced smile. He caught Harry's eye and Harry knew once that Snape's feelings toward him hadn't changed one jot. This didn't worry Harry. It seemed though life would be back normal next year, or normal it ever was Hogwarts.
   It was best evening Harry's life, better than winning Quidditch, or Christmas, or knocking out mountain trolls… he would never, ever forget tonight.
   Harry had almost forgotten that exam results were still come, but come they did. their great surprise, both he and Ron passed good marks; Hermione, course, had best grades first years. Even Neville scraped through, his good Herbology mark making up his abysmal Potions one. They had hoped that Goyle, who was almost stupid he was mean, might be thrown out, but he had passed, too. It was shame, but Ron said, you couldn't have everything life.
   And suddenly, their wardrobes were empty, their trunks were packed, Neville's toad was found lurking corner toilets; notes were handed out all students, warning them not use magic over holidays (“I always hope they'll forget give us these,” said Fred Weasley sadly); Hagrid was there take them down fleet boats that sailed across lake; they were boarding Hogwarts Express; talking and laughing countryside became greener and tidier; eating Bettie Bott's Every Flavor Beans they sped past Muggle towns; pulling off their wizard robes and putting jackets and coats; pulling platform nine and three-quarters King's Cross Station.
   It took quite while them all get off platform. wizened old guard was up by ticket barrier, letting them go through gate twos and threes so they didn't attract attention by all bursting out solid wall once and alarming Muggles.
   “You must come and stay this summer,” said Ron, “both you—I'll send you an owl.”
   “Thanks,” said Harry, “I'll need something look forward to.” People jostled them they moved forward toward gateway back Muggle world. Some them called:
   “Bye, Harry!”
   “See you, Potter!”
   “Still famous,” said Ron, grinning him.
   “Not where I'm going, I promise you,” said Harry.
   He, Ron, and Hermione passed through gateway together. “There he is, Mom, there he is, look!”
   It was Ginny Weasley, Ron's younger sister, but she wasn't pointing Ron.

   “Be quiet, Ginny, and it's rude point.”
   Mrs. Weasley smiled down them.
   “Busy year?” she said.
   “Very,” said Harry. “Thanks fudge and sweater, Mrs. Weasley.”
   “Oh, it was nothing, dear.”
   “Ready, are you?”
   It was Uncle Vernon, still purple faced, still mustached, still looking furious nerve Harry, carrying an owl cage station full ordinary people. Behind him stood Aunt Petunia and Dudley, looking terrified very sight Harry.
   “You must be Harry's family!” said Mrs. Weasley.
   “In manner speaking,” said Uncle Vernon. “Hurry up, boy, we haven't got all day.” He walked away.
   Harry hung back last word Ron and Hermione.
   “See you over summer, then.”
   “Hope you have—er—a good holiday,” said Hermione, looking uncertainly after Uncle Vernon, shocked that anyone could be so unpleasant.
   “Oh, I will,” said Harry, and they were surprised grin that was spreading over his face. “They don't know we're not allowed use magic home. I'm going have lot fun Dudley this summer…”
